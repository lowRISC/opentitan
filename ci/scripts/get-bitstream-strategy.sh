Usage: get-bitstream-strategy.sh <cached-bitstream-design> [pathspec]...

    cached-bitstream-design The design name for the cached bitstream. This script
                            will retrieve the most recent image from a commit in
                            this branch's history.
    pathspec A git pathspec (multiple instances permitted) indicating which files
                   trigger building the bitstream. Please use only exclude pathspecs
                   to cause new, unconsidered paths to trigger the build.
