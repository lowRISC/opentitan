# We'd like to reference serde_annotate by its Git repo, but we also need to
# support airgapped builds and bazel does not support git repo references
# for airgapped builds. As such, these two libraries are downloaded as
# http_archive dependencies. In order to have a globally consistent set of
# crate dependencies, we have to list the deps of those two crates here. Those
# crates reference their deps via a `@crate_index` repo. In OpenTitan, we
# create our own `@crate_index` repo which is share globally among all bazel
# sub-repositories.
