# We'd like to referece safe-ftdi and serde_annotate by their Git repos, but
# we also need to support airgapped builds and bazel does not support git
# repo references for airgapped builds.  As such, these two libraries are
# downloaded as http_archive dependencies.  In order to have a globally
# consistent set of crate dependencies, we have to list the deps of those
# two crates here.  Those crates reference their deps via a `@crate_index`
# repo.  In OpenTitan, we create our own `@crate_index` repo which is
# share globally among all bazel sub-repositories.
