# Contributing to Hardware

OpenTitan is an open-source silicon project, so naturally there are lots of aspects of the hardware design to contribute to.
Please start by having a look at the following pages:
- [Comportability](./comportability/README.md)
- [Hardware Design](./design.md)
- [Design Methodology](./methodology.md)
- [Vendoring in Hardware](./vendor.md)
- [Linting](../../../hw/lint/README.md)
- [Synthesis Flow](../../../hw/syn/README.md)
