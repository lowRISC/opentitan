# Contributing to Software

Software is an important part of testing and deploying OpenTitan.
One important distinction when discussing software is that there are multiple [cores](../../../hw/doc/cores.md) in OpenTitan that can run software, as well as software that runs on an accompanying PC for test and development purposes.
