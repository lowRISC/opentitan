## V1

For a transition from V0 to V1, the following items are expected be completed.
Prefix "SIM" is applicable for simulation-based DV approach only, while "FPV" is for FPV approach only.

### DV_PLAN_DRAFT_COMPLETED

- DV Plan document drafted, indicating the overall DV strategy, intent and the testbench environment details with diagrams, details on TB, UVCs, checkers, scoreboard, interfaces, assertions, coverage objects (if applicable).
- Details may be missing since most items are not expected to be fully developed at this stage.

### TESTPLAN_COMPLETED

A fully completed Testplan written in Hjson, indicating the list of planned tests with descriptions indicating the goal of the test and optionally details on stimulus and the checking procedure.

### TB_TOP_CREATED

- Top level testbench with DUT instantiated and following interfaces hooked up (as applicable): TileLink, clocks and resets, interrupts and major DUT interfaces.
- All interfaces may not be hooked up at this point. Inputs for which interfaces have not yet been created may be tied off to 0.

### PRELIMINARY_ASSERTION_CHECKS_ADDED

- All available interface assertion monitors hooked up (example: tlul_assert).

### SIM_TB_ENV_CREATED

- UVM environment created with major interface agents and UVCs connected and instantiated.
- TLM connections made from UVC monitors to the scoreboard.

### SIM_RAL_MODEL_GEN_AUTOMATED

RAL model is generated by using [regtool]({{< relref "/util/reggen/README.md" >}}) and instantiated in UVM environment.

### CSR_CHECK_GEN_AUTOMATED

CSR check is generated by using [regtool]({{< relref "/util/reggen/README.md" >}}) and bound in the TB environment.

### TB_GEN_AUTOMATED

Full testbench automation completed if applicable. This may be required for verifying multiple flavors of parameterized DUT designs.

### SIM_SANITY_TEST_PASSING

- Sanity test exercising a basic functionality of a major DUT datapath passing.
- What functionality to test and to what level may be governed by higher level (example: chip) integration requirements. These are to be captured when the Testplan is reviewed with the key stakeholders.

### SIM_CSR_MEM_TEST_SUITE_PASSING

CSR test suite added for ALL interfaces that have access to system memory map (JTAG, TL, etc.):
- HW reset test (test all resets)
- CSR read/write
- Bit Bash
- Aliasing

Memory test suite added for ALL interfaces that have access to system memory map (JTAG, TL, etc.) if the DUT has memories:
- Mem walk

Ensure all these tests verify back-2back access with zero delays, along with partial reads and partial writes.

### FPV_MAIN_ASSERTIONS_PROVEN

- Each input and each output of the module is part of at least one assertion.
- Assertions for main functional path are implemented and proven.

### SIM_ALT_TOOL_SETUP

Verify that the sanity test passes cleanly (with no warnings) with one additional tool apart from the primary tool selected for signoff.

### SIM_SANITY_REGRESSION_SETUP

Sanity regression set up for code health. A small suite of tests identified for running the sanity regression on. If the testbench has more than one compile-time configuration, then a sanity test for each configuration should be ideally selected.

### SIM_NIGHTLY_REGRESSION_SETUP

Nightly regression for running all tests with multiple random seeds (iterations) setup. Selecting the number of iterations for running each test is subjective - it depends on the failure rate and available compute resources. For starters, it is recommended to set iterations to 100 for each test. It may be trimmed down if the compute load is too high. As such, the goal should be to have the nightly regression finish overnight so that the results are available next morning for triage.

### FPV_REGRESSION_SETUP

Set up FPV regression by adding the module to `hw/formal/fpv_all` script.

### SIM_COVERAGE_MODEL_ADDED

- Structural coverage collection model checked in. This specifies what hierarchies and what types of coverage to collect. For example, pre-verified sub-mudules (including some `prim` components pre-verified thoroughly with FPV) can be black-boxed and only IO toggle coverage can be setup for those sub-modules for coverage collection.
- Functional coverage shell object created - this may not contain coverpoints or covergroups yet, but it is primed for use in post-V2 test development.

### PRE_VERIFIED_SUB_MODULES_V1

Sub-modules that are pre-verified with their own testbenches have already reached V1 or higher stage.

### DESIGN_SPEC_REVIEWED

RTL (uArch) specification reviewed and signed off.

### DV_PLAN_TESTPLAN_REVIEWED

DV Plan & Testplan reviewed with key stakeholders - designer, design lead, DV lead, architects, higher level (chip) design and DV leads.

### STD_TEST_CATEGORIES_PLANNED

Following categories of post-V1 tests focused at in the Testplan review (as applicable):
- Security/error
- Power
- Performance
- Debug
- Stress

### V2_CHECKLIST_SCOPED

Reviewed V2 checklist to understand scope and estimate effort.

Prefix "SIM" is applicable for simulation-based DV approach only, while "FPV" is for FPV approach only.
