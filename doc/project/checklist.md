## V1

For a transition from V0 to V1, the following items are expected be completed.

### DV_PLAN_DRAFT_COMPLETED

- DV Plan document drafted, indicating the overall DV strategy, intent and the testbench environment details with diagrams, details on TB, UVCs, checkers, scoreboard, interfaces, assertions,
coverage objects.
- Details may be missing since most items are not expected to be fully developed at this stage.

### TESTPLAN_COMPLETED

A fully completed Testplan written in Hjson, indicating the list of planned tests with descriptions indicating the goal of the test and optionally details on stimulus and the checking procedure.

### TB_TOP_CREATED

- Top level testbench with DUT instantiated and following interfaces hooked up (as applicable): TileLink, clocks and resets, interrupts and major DUT interfaces.
- All interfaces may not be hooked up at this point. Inputs for which interfaces have not yet been created may be tied off to 0.

### PRELIMINARY_ASSERTION_CHECKS_ADDED

- All available interface assertion monitors hooked up (example: tlul_assert)

### TB_ENV_CREATED

- UVM enviroment created with major interface agents and UVCs connected and instantiated.
- TLM connections made from UVC monitors to the scoreboard

### RAL_MODEL_GEN_AUTOMATED

RAL model is generated by using [regtool]({{< relref "/util/reggen/README.md" >}}) and instantiated in UVM environment.

### TB_GEN_AUTOMATED

Full testbench automation completed if applicable. This may be required for verifying multiple flavors of parameterized DUT designs.

### SANITY_TEST_PASSING

- Sanity test exercising a basic functionality of a major DUT datapath passing
- What functionality to test and to what level may be governed by higher level (example: chip) integration requirements. These are to be captured when the Testplan is reviewed with the key stakeholders.

### CSR_MEM_TEST_SUITE_PASSING

CSR test suite added for ALL interfaces that have access to system memory map (JTAG, TL, etc.):
- HW reset test (test all resets)
- CSR read/write
- Bit Bash
- Aliasing

Memory test suite added for ALL interfaces that have access to system memory map (JTAG, TL, etc.) if the DUT has memories:
- Mem walk

Ensure all these tests verify back-2back access with zero delays, along with partial reads and partial writes.

### SANITY_REGRESSION_SETUP

Sanity regression set up for code health. A small suite of tests identified for running the sanity regression on. If the testbench has more than one compile-time configuration, then a sanity test for each configuration should be ideally selected.

### NIGHTLY_REGRESSION_SETUP

Nightly regression for running all tests with multiple random seeds (iterations) setup. Selecting the number of iterations for running each test is subjective - it depends on the failure rate and available compute resources. For starters, it is recommended to set iterations to 100 for each test. It may be trimmed down if the compute load is too high. As such, the goal should be to have the nightly regression finish overnight so that the results are available next morning for triage.

### ALT_TOOL_SETUP

Verify that the sanity test passes cleanly (with no warnings) with one additional tool apart from the primary tool selected for signoff.

### COVERAGE_MODEL_ADDED

- Structural coverage collection model checked in. This specifies what hierarchies and what types of coverage to collect. For example, pre-verified sub-mudules (including some `prim` components pre-verified thoroughly with FPV) can be black-boxed and only IO toggle coverage can be setup for those sub-modules for coverage collection.
- Functional coverage shell object created - this may not contain coverpoints or covergroups yet, but it is primed for use in post-V2 test development.

### PRE_VERIFIED_SUB_MODULES_V1

Sub-modules that are pre-verified with their own testbenches have already reached V1 or higher stage.

### DESIGN_SPEC_REVIEWED

RTL (uArch) specification reviewed and signed off.

### DV_PLAN_TESTPLAN_REVIEWED

DV Plan & Testplan reviewed with key stakeholders - designer, design lead, DV lead, architects, higher level (chip) design and DV leads.

### STD_TEST_CATEGORIES_PLANNED

Following categories of post-V1 tests focused at in the Testplan review (as applicable):
- Security/error
- Power
- Performance
- Debug
- Stress

### V2_CHECKLIST_SCOPED

Reviewed V2 checklist to understand scope and estimate effort.

## V2

### DESIGN_DELTAS_CAPTURED

It is possible for the design to have undergone some changes since the DV plan and Testplan was reviewed prior to V1 stage. Please ensure that those deltas have been captured adequately in the DV Plan and the Testplan documents.

### DV_PLAN_COMPLETED

DV Plan is fully completed in terms of content.

### ALL_INTERFACES_EXERCISED

All interfaces including sidebands have been connected and exercised.

### ALL_ASSERTION_CHECKS_ADDED

All planned assertions have been written and enabled.

### NIGHTLY_REGRESSION_V2

### CODE_COVERAGE_V2

Code coverage requirements: line, toggle, fsm (state & transition), branch, assertion: 90%

### FUNCTIONAL_COVERAGE_V2

Functional coverage requirements: coverpoints: 100%, crosses: 75%

### NO_HIGH_PRIORITY_ISSUES_PENDING

Ensure that all high priority (tagged P0 and P1) design bugs have been addressed and closed. If the bugs were found elsewhere, ensure that they are reproduced deterministically in DV (through additional tests or by tweaking existing tests as needed) and the fixes are adequately verified.

### ALL_LOW_PRIORITY_ISSUES_ROOT_CAUSED

Ensure that all low priority (tagged P2 and P3) design bugs habe been root-caused. They may be deferred to post D2V2 for closure.

### PRE_VERIFIED_SUB_MODULES_V2

Sub-modules that are pre-verified with their own testbenches have already reached V2 or higher stage.

### V3_CHECKLIST_SCOPED

Reviewed V3 checklist to understand scope and estimate effort.

## V3

### DESIGN_DELTAS_CAPTURED_IF_ANY

It is possible for the design to undergo changes even at this stage (when it is expected to be mature). Please ensure that those new deltas have been captured adequately in the DV Plan and the Testplan documents.

### ALL_TODOS_RESOLVED

Ensure that the complete testbench code is free from TODOs.

### X_PROP_ANALYSIS_COMPLETED
