title: "Introduction to the OpenTitan Project"

OpenTitan is a collaborative hardware and software development program with contributors from many organization.
This area gives some more information about how the project itself is organized.
More information will be added over time.

## Quality standards for open hardware IP

In order to gauge the quality of the different IP that is in our repository, we define a series of [Hardware Development Stages]({{< relref "hw_stages" >}}) to track the designs.
The current status of different IP is reflected in the [HW Development Stages Dashboard]({{< relref "hw_dashboard" >}}).
The final state for developed IP is *Signed Off*, indicating that design and verification is complete, and the IP should be bug free.
To make it to that stage, a [Hardware Signoff Checklist]({{< relref "checklist.md" >}}) is used to confirm completion.

## Initiating new development

The [OpenTitan RFC process]({{< relref "rfc_process" >}}) guides developers on how to initiate new development within the program.
