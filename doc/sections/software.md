## ![OpenTitan logo](../images/otlogo.png) OpenTitan Software

This section is the landing spot for software documentation within the OpenTitan project.
There are three major parts to the OpenTitan software stack:
- The device software, which runs on the primary core within the OpenTitan platform chip.
- The OTBN software, which runs on the OTBN cryptographic co-processor within the OpenTitan platform chip.
- The host software, which is run on a host device and interacts with an OpenTitan device.

Starting points are the [Reference Manual](./util/README.md) and [User Guide](./doc/getting_started/README.md) areas.
