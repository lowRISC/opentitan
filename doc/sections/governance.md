## ![OpenTitan logo](../images/otlogo.png) OpenTitan Governance and Policies

OpenTitan is stewarded by [lowRISC CIC](../project_governance/lowRISC.md), a not-for-profit company that uses collaborative engineering to develop and maintain open source silicon designs and tools for the long term.
As a lowRISC CIC Chartered Project, OpenTitan governance is handled via the [OpenTitan Charter](https://static.opentitan.org/technical-charter.pdf).

As described in full detail in the [OpenTitan Charter](https://static.opentitan.org/technical-charter.pdf), the governance structure consists of:
* The [Governing Board](../project_governance/governing_board.md), responsible for project oversight and agreeing the technical roadmap.
* The [Technical Committee](../project_governance/technical_committee.md), responsible for technical decision making required to implement the technical roadmap.
* [Working Groups](../project_governance/working_group.md) allow specialists in the relevant area to work together in proposing technical decisions relevant to that workstream and function under the overview of the OpenTitan Technical Committee.
