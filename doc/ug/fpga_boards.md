title: "Get an FPGA Board"
---

FPGA boards come at different price points, with the price being a good indicator for how much logic the FPGA can hold.
The following sections give details of how to obtain our supported FPGA boards.

## Nexys Video

The Nexys Video board features a Xilinx Artix 7 XC7A200T FPGA.
The board is produced by Digilent.

### Ordering

You can get the Nexys Video board from the [Digilent web store](https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/).
Significant discounts are available for academic users (including students), see the [Digilent academic price list](https://reference.digilentinc.com/_media/sales-resources/academic_prices.pdf) for details.

Most large electronics distributors like Farnell/element14, RS Components, Mouser or Digikey list the board as well.

### Notes

* The board ships with a US and European power plug. Users in other countries need to use or order an adapter, e.g. [this one from the Digilent store](https://store.digilentinc.com/european-uk-wall-plug-adapter/) (but any travel adapter works).
