# Build Software

## Prerequisites

_Make sure you followed the install instructions to [prepare the system]({{< relref "install_instructions#system-preparation" >}}) and install the [compiler toolchain]({{< relref "install_instructions#compiler-toolchain" >}})._

## Building software

OpenTitan software is built using [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com).
However, Meson is not an exact fit for a lot of things OpenTitan does (such as distinguishing between FPGA, ASIC, and simulations), so the setup is a little bit different.

For example, the following commands build the `boot_rom` and `hello_world` binaries for FPGA:

```console
# Configure the Meson environment.
$ cd $REPO_TOP
$ ./meson_init.sh

# Build the two targets we care about, specifically.
$ ninja -C build-out sw/device/boot_rom/boot_rom_export_fpga_nexysvideo
$ ninja -C build-out sw/device/examples/hello_world/hello_world_export_fpga_nexysvideo

# Build *everything*, including targets for other devices.
$ ninja -C build-out all
```

Note that specific targets are followed by the device they are built for.
OpenTitan needs to link the same device executable for multiple devices, so each executable target is duplicated one for each device we support.

If your RISC-V toolchain isn't located in the default `/tools/riscv` location you use the `TOOLCHAIN_PATH` environment variable to set a different location before running `meson_init.sh`:

```console
# Set toolchain location
$ export TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/path/to/toolchain
$ ./meson_init.sh
```

In general, `clean` rules are unnecessary, and Meson will set up `ninja` such that it reruns `meson.build` files which have changed.

Build intermediates will show up in `$REPO_TOP/build-out`, including unlinked object files and libraries, while completed executables are exported to `$REPO_TOP/build-bin`.
As a rule, you should only ever need to refer to artifacts inside of `build-bin`; the exact structure of `build-out` is subject to change.
Complete details of these semantics are documented in `util/build_consts.sh`.

The locations of `build-{out,bin}` can be controled by setting the `$BUILD_ROOT` enviromnent variable, which defaults to `$REPO_TOP`.

`./meson_init.sh` itself is idempotent, but this behavior can be changed with additional flags; see `./meson_init.sh` for more information.
For this reason, most examples involving Meson will include a call to `./meson_init.sh`, but you will rarely need to run it more than once per checkout.

Building an executable `foo` destined to run on the OpenTitan device `$DEVICE` will output the following files under `build-bin/sw/device`:
* `foo_$DEVICE.elf`: the linked program, in ELF format.
* `foo_$DEVICE.bin`: the linked program, as a plain binary with ELF debug information removed.
* `foo_$DEVICE.dis`: the disassembled program with inline source code.
* `foo_$DEVICE.vmem`: a Verilog memory file which can be read by `$readmemh()` in Verilog code.

In general, this executable is built by building the `foo_export_$DEVICE` target.

Building an executable destined to run on a host machine (i.e., under `sw/host`) will output a host excecutable under `build-bin/sw/host`, which can be run directly.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter an error running `./meson_init.sh` you could re-run using the `-f` flag which will erase any existing building directories to yield a clean build. This sledgehammer is only intended to be used as a last resort when the existing configuration is seriously broken.
```console
$ ./meson_init.sh -f
```
If any `meson.build` files are changed the configuration can be regenerated by passing the `-r` flag to `./meson_init.sh`
```console
$ ./meson_init.sh -r
```
