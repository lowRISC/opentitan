title: "Crossbar Generation Tool"
---

The crossbar tool `tlgen.py` is used to build the TL-UL crossbar RTL. It is used
standalone or invoked as part of top module generation process.
`hw/top_earlgrey/ip/xbar/rtl/autogen/*.sv` RTLs are generated with the crossbar
tool.  This document doesn't explain its internal blocks. [Bus
Specification]({{< relref "hw/ip/tlul/doc" >}}) explains the protocol and the
components used in the crossbar.

## Standalone tlgen.py

The standalone `tlgen.py` is a python3 script to read crossbar Hjson
configuration file and generate crossbar package, crossbar RTL, and the simple
DV test for checking the connectivity.

The `--help` flag is supported to print the usage.

### Example and Results

The example of the crossbar Hjson is given in
`util/example/tlgen/xbar_main.hjson`.

The package file and RTL can be created by the command below:

```console
    $ util/tlgen.py -t util/example/tlgen/xbar_main.hjson -o /tmp/
```

It creates the files in `/tmp/{rtl|dv}`. While generating the RTL, the tool
creates the connection information into the header of the RTL.

## Configuration File Format

The `tlgen` reads an Hjson file containing the crossbar connections and the
hosts and devices information. It is the description of generic Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) with some additional clock information and steering information.

If the tool is used in the process of top generation (`topgen.py`), a few fields
are derived from the top Hjson configuration module structure.

A description of Hjson and the recommended style is in the [Hjson Usage and
Style Guide]({{< relref "hjson_usage_style" >}}).

The tables below describe the keys for each context. The tool raises an error if
*Required* keys are missing. *Optional* keys may be provided in the input files.
The tool also may insert the optional keys with default value.

## Fabrication process

The tool fabricates a sparse crossbar from the given Hjson configuration file.
At first, the tool creates Vertex(Node) and Edge. Then it creates internal
building blocks such as Asynchronous FIFO, Socket 1:N, or Socket M:1 at the
elaboration stage. Please refer to `util/tlgen/elaborate.py` for the details.

### Traversing DAG

The tool, after building Nodes and Edges, traverses downstream from every Host
nodes towards downstream during elaboration. In the process of traversal, it adds
internal blocks if necessary. If all Nodes are visited, the tool completes
traversing then moves to RTL generation stage.

1. Generates Nodes and Edges from the Hjson. Start node should be Host and end
   node should be Device.
2. (for loop) Visit every hosts
3. If a node has different clock from main clock and not Async FIFO,
    1. (New Node) Create Async FIFO Node.
    2. If the Node is host, revise every edges from the node to have start node
       in Async FIFO. (New Edge) Create an Edge from the Node to Async FIFO. Then go to Step 3
       with Async FIFO Node. Eventually, the connection is changed to `host ->
       async_fifo -> downstreams` from `host -> downstreams`.
    3. Revise every Edge to the Node to have Async FIFO as a downstream port.
       (New Edge) Create an Edge from the Async FIFO to the Node.
    4. If it is not the Device, raise Error. If it is, repeat from Step 2 with
       next item.
4. If a Node has multiple Edges pointing it as a downstream port, `nodes -> this
   node` and not Socket  M:1,
    1. (New Node) Create Socket M:1.
    2. Revise every Edge to the Node to point Socket M:1 as a downstream port
    3. (New Edge) Create an Edge from Socket M:1 to the Node.
        The new connections look like `nodes -> socket_m1 -> this node`.
    4. Repeat from Step 3 with the Node.
5. If a Node has multiple Edges and not Socket 1:N,
    1. (New Node) Create Socket 1:N Node.
    2. Revise every Edge from the Node to point to Socket 1:N as an upstream port
    3. (New Edge) Create an Edge from the Node to Socket 1:N.
    4. (for loop) Repeat from Step 3 with Socket 1:N's downstream Nodes.

Below shows the example of 2 Hosts and 2 Devices connection

![Example Topology](crossbar_example_1.svg)

Each circle represents a Node and an arrow represents an Edge that has downward
direction. The tool starts from `H0` Node. As the Node has two downstream Edges
and not Socket 1:N, the tool creates Socket 1:N based on the condition #5 above.
Then repeat the process from Socket 1:N Node's children Nodes, `D0` and `D1`.

![Socket 1:N instantiated](crossbar_example_2.svg)

For `D0`, the tool creates Socket M:1 based on the condition #4. Then visit its
downstream Node, `D0` again. In this case, it doesn't create Async FIFO as the
clock is same as main clock. So it reached the terminal Node. Then visit `D1`.
It repeats the same step (condition #4) as `D0`, which creates another Socket
M:1.

![Socket M:1 instantiated to D0, D1](crossbar_example_3.svg)

As all Nodes from `H0` have been visited, the tool repeats all steps from `H1`.
It applies condition #3 above as `H1` has peripheral clock rather than main
clock. So the tool creates an Asynch FIFO and moves the pointer to the Node and
repeats.

![Async FIFO instantiated to H1](crossbar_example_4.svg)

It applies #5 as Async FIFO has multiple downstream Nodes(Edges) and it is not
Socket 1:N. The tool creates a Socket 1:N and visit every downstream Nodes.

Both Nodes are processed. So no condition is hit. The tool completes traversing.

### Numbering

After the traversing is completed, Hosts and Devices only have one Edge and
internal Sockets have multiple Edges. The tool assigns increasing numbers into
each Edge starting from 0. This helps the tool to connect between Nodes.

### Propagating the steering information (Address)

After the numbering is done, the tool propagates the steering information,
address from every Device Nodes to the upstream until it hits Socket 1:N. Socket
1:N is the only module that utilizes the `base_addr` and `size_bytes`.

It is assumed that at most only one Socket 1:N exists on the path from a Host to
a Device within a crossbar. If any SoC requires multi-tiered crossbar design, it
should have more than one crossbar communicate each other.

### Connection information

The tool creates DAG connections when it creates RTL to help understanding the
fabric. The information is put in the header of the RTL. For instance, above 2x2
example has the information below.

```
    $ util/tlgen.py -t util/example/tlgen/xbar_2x2.hjson -o /tmp/
    $ cat /tmp/rtl/xbar_2x2.sv
// ...
// Interconnect
// h0
//   -> s1n_4
//     -> sm1_5
//       -> d0
//     -> sm1_6
//       -> d1
// h1
//   -> asf_7
//     -> s1n_8
//       -> sm1_5
//         -> d0
//       -> sm1_6
//         -> d1
// ...
```
