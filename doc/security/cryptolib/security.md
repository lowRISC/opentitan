# OpenTitan Cryptography Library Security Hardening
The library uses a mix of hardware- and software-based countermeasures that aim to mitigate side-channel and fault injection attacks.
For the hardware-based countermeasures, please refer to the documentation of the corresponding IP block.
The software-based countermeasures are listed below:

## Algorithm Specific Countermeasures

### AES

The following software-based countermeasures are implemented:
- To mitigate fault injection attacks on the execution of the AES, a decrypt-after-encrypt or encrypt-after-decrypt strategy is used.

### AES-GCM

The following software-based countermeasures are implemented:
- To mitigate fault injection attacks on the execution of AES-GCM, a decrypt-after-encrypt or encrypt-after-decrypt strategy is used.
- Masking is offered for the GHASH computation to thwart side-channel attacks.

### ECC

The following software-based countermeasures are implemented:
- To mitigate fault injection attacks on the execution of ECDSA, a verify-after-sign strategy is used.
  The secret key is additively masked and the modular arithmetic operations modulo the point order to compute s are masked.
- P256:
  - Uses a constant-time square and multiply always algorithm processing an additively shared scalar.
  - Scalars (both ephemeral and secret keys) are additionally always blinded using a 64b multiple of the curve order.
  - For ECDH and key generation from a HW-backed seed, scalars are blinded using a 65b random multiple of the point order (as per [Schindler and Wiemers](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/workshop-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography-standards/documents/papers/session6-schindler-werner.pdf)).
  - The exponentiation operates on projective coordinates with re-randomisation of the used additive points P and 2P on every iteration.
  - Processing of the masked and blinded scalar is hardened against SCA leakage.
  - We check if input points and results of EC scalar multiplications satisfy the curve equation.
- P384 uses the same countermeasures with a blinding factor of 194b instead of 65b.

### HMAC

The following software-based countermeasures are implemented:
- The HMAC operation is executed twice to mitigate fault injection attacks.
- Shuffling is implemented for the hashing of the key to protect against side-channel analysis attacks.

### RSA
Modular exponentiation is the core operation for both RSA encryption/sign and key generation.
It is implemented as a constant-time Montgomery Ladder with Boolean-masked exponents and blinded base points as detailed in the following works:
- https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1226.pdf
- https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1873548.1873556
The combination of both countermeasures results in an exponentiation that is resistant against vertical and horizontal power analysis.
This hardened exponentiation is reused in the primality check routine of the key generation algorithm.
