# OpenTitan Cryptography Library

The OpenTitan project includes a platform-specific library of cryptographic functions designed to make use of available hardware acceleration.
For details about the library's interface, see the [API documentation page](cryptolib_api.md).

Note that at time of writing, the library is still under development, and some algorithms may not be fully implemented.
