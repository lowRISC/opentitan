# Building documentation

The documentation for OpenTitan is available [online](https://opentitan.org).
The creation of documentation is mainly based around the conversion from Markdown to HTML files with [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
Rules for how to write correct Markdown files can be found in the [reference manual](https://opentitan.org/book/doc/contributing/style_guides/markdown_usage_style.html).

## Building locally

There are a few project specific [preprocessors](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/preprocessors.html).
These preprocessors require the installation of the dependencies outlined in the [previous section](README.md#step-2-install-package-manager-dependencies).
`util/site/build-docs.sh` handles building all books in the repository and other auto-generated content, such as the API documentation generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

### Running the server

In order to run a local instance of the documentation server run the following command from the root of the project repository.

```sh
./util/site/build-docs.sh serve
```

This will execute the preprocessing, build the documentation and finally start a local server.
The output will indicate at which address the local instance can be accessed.
The default is [http://0.0.0.0:9000](http://0.0.0.0:9000).
