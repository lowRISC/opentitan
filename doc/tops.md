# Tops

A top is a verified assembly of OpenTitan [HWIP](../hw/ip/README.md) to create a functional system.
A top may be realized as a discrete chip or a subsystem of a larger SoC.

The following tops currently exist in the repository:

- [Earl Grey](../hw/top_earlgrey/README.md)
- [English Breakfast (experimental)](https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/tree/master/hw/top_englishbreakfast)
