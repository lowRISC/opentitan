# OpenTitan Working Group Terms of Reference

## Purpose {#purpose}

Each OpenTitan workstream or sub-project may have an associated working group (OTWG).
These allow specialists in the relevant area to work together in proposing technical decisions relevant to that workstream.
OTWGs function under the overview of the OpenTitan Technical Committee (OTTC) which has overall responsibility for technical decision making and the OpenTitan Governing Board (OTGB) which has overall responsibility for roadmap and governance.
An OTWG can be seen as a Community of Practice, built around the three areas below:

* Domain: A domain of knowledge creates common ground, inspires participation, guides learning, and gives meaning to the actions of the individuals and community.
* Community: A strong community fosters interactions and encourages people to collaborate and share ideas.
* Practice: The practice is the specific focus around which the community develops, shares and maintains its core of knowledge.

## Expectations and Conduct {#expectations-and-conduct}

All OpenTitan spaces, including the OTWGs, are covered by the OpenTitan code of conduct to ensure a welcoming and respectful community.
Beyond this, OTWG members are expected to follow the guidance below:

* Each OTWG member has a good faith duty to act in the best interests of the OpenTitan Project when performing their role as a OTWG member.
* Be active participants in development discussions within the OpenTitan Project, beyond just OTWG  meetings.
* Ensure that feedback has been sought from all relevant stakeholders, and appropriate effort has been made to find consensus within the OpenTitan contributor community.
* Put aside sufficient time on a week-by-week basis to review active proposals and give feedback.
* Collaborate to deliver on the responsibilities of the OTWG.

## Working groups

The following OpenTitan working groups currently exist:

- Software Working Group
  - Chair: Luis Marques
- Silicon Working Group
  - Chair: Andreas Kurth
- Security Working Group
  - Chairs: Pirmin Vogel, Johann Heyszl
- Integrated Working Group
  - Chair: Andreas Kurth

## Membership {#membership}

Each OTWG will keep a record of its members and may appoint new members as appropriate.
A OTWG can be created where required by a vote of the OTTC.
If an OTWG is no longer required, it can be disbanded by a vote of the OTTC.

## Roles {#roles}

Each OTWG will have a Chair which facilitates the effective functioning of the OTWG.
The Chair is appointed by the OTTC.
Ideally the OTWG will propose a consensus candidate.
The OTTC can appoint a new Chair at any time.

## Appointing members {#appointing-members}

Membership of the OTWG is appointed by the OTTC.
The OTTC may allow all OT members to self-enroll to an OTWG.
Where possible, each OTWG should include a representative of all partners included in the OTTC.
Lack of available specialists may make this impossible in some cases.
Having multiple members from the same partner is acceptable, but imbalancing an OTWG towards a single partner should be avoided.

## Meetings {#meetings}

OTWG meetings will be held regularly on an agreed schedule.
The Chair may call additional meetings when one is needed outside the schedule.
If a meeting has no agenda items (see below), the Chair may cancel it ahead of time.
Minutes should be kept in a form accessible to OTWG and OTTC members but will be considered confidential to these groups.

### Notification of meetings {#notification-of-meetings}

Agenda items should be submitted at least three days in advance of the meeting.
The Chair should circulate the agenda at least two days in advance of the meeting.

### Voting and quoracy {#voting-and-quoracy}

Each OTWG functions by consensus, not by vote.
If a choice cannot be resolved within the OTWG, it should be escalated to the OTTC for a decision.

### Communication {#communication}

Decisions and action points should be recorded and distributed to OTWG members and the OTTC no later than a week after the meeting.
Where OTWG decisions affect the broader OpenTitan community, the Chair should ensure that information is sent, or documentation updated, in a timely manner.

## Responsibilities {#responsibilities}

Each OTWG has responsibility for an area of technology agreed with the OTTC when the OTWG is created.
Within this technology area, the OTWG is responsible for sharing good practice and agreeing how to implement the roadmap in the most appropriate manner.

## Modifying the terms of reference {#modifying-the-terms-of-reference}

The OTWG Terms of Reference are set by the OTTC and any changes to this document should be made by the OTTC or OTGB.
