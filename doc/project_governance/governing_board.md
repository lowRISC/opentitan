## Purpose

The OpenTitan Governing Board (OTGB) is part of the [OpenTitan governance structure](./README.md).
It is responsible for all oversight of the Project including setting its strategy.
Terms of Reference for the OTGB are set in the OpenTitan Technical Charter which is the definitive reference for OTGB governance.

* Jay Alphey (lowRISC)
* Miguel Osorio (Google)
* Ran Klier (Nuvoton)

## Roles

An OTGB Chair would be advisable.

## Appointing members

Membership of the OTGB is defined in the OpenTitan Technical Charter.

## Meetings

OTGB meetings will be held regularly on an agreed schedule.

The chair has no enhanced voting rights as a result of their position.

### Communication

Decisions and action points should be recorded and distributed to OTGB members no later than a week after the meeting.
Where OTGB decisions affect the broader OpenTitan community, the Chair should ensure that information is sent, or documentation updated, in a timely manner.
