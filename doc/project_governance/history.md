# OpenTitan History

## Introduction

![OpenTitan booting](../images/otboot.jpg)

Google launched the OpenTitan project together with lowRISC and its partners in 2018 with the goal to make a completely transparent and trustworthy secure silicon platform.
It is the world’s first open-source secure chip to include commercial-grade design verification, top-level testing and continuous integration.

With Google’s support, the project took off from its first year, setting it on a trajectory to make it the most active and successful open-source silicon project in history.
Throughout its lifetime, the OpenTitan coalition thrived as an open silicon ecosystem, consistently following a well-defined roadmap from discrete to integrated secure silicon designs.
The project partners are deeply engaged in this process, ensuring that the final designs are adaptable to many applications.
OpenTitan also has a large and growing community of contributors beyond its formal partners.
As a whole, the community resolves hundreds of pull requests and issues monthly.
