"""Transition rules for accessing the host platform

This file contains transition rules for accessing the host platform's
configuration. Primarily, this provides transitions for rules where a tool runs
on the host but the target configuration is not the host. For rules where
the host configuration is not adequate, toolchains should be used instead.
