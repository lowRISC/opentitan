# This target provides a C header containing all stamping variables.
#
#  By default, or when building with --nostamp, this rule produces an empty
#  C header file.
#
#  When building with --stamp, this rule will output a C header like the
#  following example:
#    #define BAZEL_BUILD_SCM_REVISION_SHORT 0d6b3555
#    #define BAZEL_BUILD_SCM_STATUS clean
#    #define BAZEL_BUILD_TIMESTAMP 1743189267
#    ...
#
# To avoid rebuilding to all dependents as transitive header, this generated
# file should be included in srcs instead of deps.
