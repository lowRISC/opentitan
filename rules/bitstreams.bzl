"""Rules to interface with bitstreams caches

This Starlark library comprises several rules for interfacing with bitstreams
caches.

`bitstreams_repo` is a `repository_rule` that reaches out to a remote bitstreams
cache, downloads files to create a local cache, and creates a @bitstreams
external repository (for bazel) with filegroup targets that represent the
designs present in the selected cache entry.

The rest of the rules are ordinary build rules for creating cache entries,
which ultimately are tarballs containing the bitstream build outputs and a
manifest file (manifest.json at the root of the tarball) that describes how
the files are grouped to represent a particular design.

A full cache entry contains information about multiple designs, but the rules
below also create a notion of "manifest fragments," which are essentially
conforming directories with a manifest and the files for a single design. These
fragments combine to create a full cache entry. Bazel targets are made aware of
these fragments via the BitstreamManifestFragmentInfo provider, which contains
all the relevant information to process them.

The cache entry is broken into fragments here to enable different build flows,
where bitstreams may be built on independent agents / bazel services and may be
passed to downstream jobs as though they were part of a bitstreams cache. In
addition, the cache entry to be uploaded may continue to be made up of both
freshly-built bitstreams and cached bitstreams (i.e. mix-and-match). Optimized
build flows may not build every bitstream merely because one isolated design's
files have changed.

For the manifest.json file, the schema describing its format is at
`//rules/scripts:bitstreams_manifest_schema` at the time of writing.

The rules:
    - `bitstream_generate_manifest_fragment`
        - Takes the outputs of a bitstream build and generates a manifest
          fragment.
    - `bitstreams_fragment_from_manifest`
        - Takes a cache entry (e.g. from the @bitstreams external repository)
          and creates a manifest fragment for a selected design.

Together, these rules enable flexibility in choosing whether to build a
particular bitstream or use cached version for the next cache entry, for each
design (i.e. mix-and-match).
