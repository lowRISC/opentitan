# Generate SPX keys

## SPX key generation

ttrippel generated SPX+ keys on a RAM disk using `opentitantool`.
The SPX+ keys were archived into a ZIP file and copied onto NitroKeys `earlgrey_a0_005` and `earlgrey_a0_006`.
The `test_0` and `dev_0` SPX private keys were copied onto NitroKeys 000-004 so that we can perform SPX+ signing with `opentitantool` until such time as we can perform SPX+ operations with the HSM.

TODO: document commands used to generate the SPX keys.
