# HSM Initialization Ceremony Continued 2023-06-07

## Create a DKEK for NitroKeys

We reconstructed the DKEK password from the shares created yesterday:

```bash
$ ssss-combine -t 3 -x
# Enter DKEK fragments when prompted.
```

Because `ssss-combine` does not provide a way to know if the reconstructed secret is valid, we opened evidence bag KK2917859 and verified the reconstructed password.
To prevent having to verify with the original password, we created a sha256sum of the DKEK password:

```bash
$ sha256sum
# type in dkek password followed by <enter> followed by <ctrl-d>.
ca1c8673418dee114e3a6f23ae616dfbe46a2c9f55d86f66e90e91eabbd9347e  -
```

We printed a document containing the sha256sum and hand-wrote the original DKEK password onto that paper.  At the end of NitroKey initialization, it was re-sealed it into evidence bag KK2917762.
The previous paper containing the DKEK password was destroyed in a cross-cut shredder.

We created a NitroKey DKEK with the following command:
```bash
$ sc-hsm-tool --create-dkek-share earlgrey_a0.pbe
```

## Backup of HSM resources

We created an `HSM` drive in the OpenTitan domain.  We backed up the HSM security world and the NitroKey DKEK to the HSM drive.

```bash
$ cd /opt/nfast
$ tar czvf /tmp/security_world-2023-06-07.tar.gz kmdata/
$ sha256sum /tmp/security_world-2023-06-07.tar.gz
7e33bbdd5a6e3b1324c2a1502f09c8eb3eab0038e6c5c9bf289453141ddca039  /tmp/security_world-2023-06-07.tar.gz
```

## Provisioning NitroKeys

The `earlgrey_a0_test_0` and `earlgrey_a0_dev_0` private keys were exported from the HSM and transformed into PKCS#12 containers.

```bash
# Change directory to a RAM disk so no key material will be saved to long-term storage.
$ cd /dev/shm
$ mkdir cfrantz; chmod 700 cfrantz; cd cfrantz

# Unlock the HSM
$ /opt/nfast/bin/preload -c earlgrey_a0 /bin/bash
# cfrantz, ttrippel and present their cards and passphrases to the HSM.
# We use one of the spare OCS cards to provide the third credential.

# Set the environment variables needed.
(subshell)$ export HSMTOOL_MODULE=/opt/nfast/toolkits/pkcs11/libcknfast.so

# Export private key material.
(subshell)$ export HSMTOOL_MODULE=/opt/nfast/toolkits/pkcs11/libcknfast.so
(subshell)$ hsmtool --token earlgrey_a0 -u user rsa export --private -l earlgrey_a0_test_0 earlgrey_a0_test_0.pem
(subshell)$ hsmtool --token earlgrey_a0 -u user rsa export --private -l earlgrey_a0_dev_0 earlgrey_a0_dev_0.pem
(subshell)$ exit

# Transform into a PKCS#12 container
$ openssl req -new -x509 -key earlgrey_a0_test_0.pem \
    -out earlgrey_a0_test_0.cert -days 99999 \
    -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=SanJose/O=OpenTitan/CN=earlgrey_a0_test_0"
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -out test_0.p12 \
    -inkey earlgrey_a0_test_0.pem -in earlgrey_a0_test_0.cert –passout "pass:abc123"

$ openssl req -new -x509 -key earlgrey_a0_dev_0.pem \
    -out earlgrey_a0_dev_0.cert -days 99999 \
    -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=SanJose/O=OpenTitan/CN=earlgrey_a0_dev_0"
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -out dev_0.p12 \
    -inkey earlgrey_a0_dev_0.pem -in earlgrey_a0_dev_0.cert –passout "pass:abc123"
```

After creating PKCS#12 containers, `scsh3gui` (aka SmartCard Shell) was used to initialize a NitroKey and import the PKCS#12 containers.
Because `scsh3gui` can be rather tedious to use, we used `sc-hsm-tool` to perform the wrap/unwrap procedure to duplicate TEST/DEV key materials onto the other NitroKeys.

### Initializing additional NitroKeys

The following script was executed for each key, varying the PIN and LABEL (`earlgrey_a0_nnn`).
Pins were selected randomly with python `random.randint(100000,999999)`.
The unwrapped DKEK password was supplied when prompted.

`nitro-init.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

: ${SOPIN:=0123456789abcdef}
: ${PIN:=123456}
: ${LABEL:=earlgrey_a0_000}

sc-hsm-tool --initialize \
    --label ${LABEL} \
    --so-pin ${SOPIN} \
    --pin ${PIN} \
    --dkek-shares 1

sc-hsm-tool --import-dkek-share earlgrey_a0.pbe
```

For each key, the script was executed as follows:
```bash
$ LABEL=earlgrey_a0_nnn PIN=xxxxxx ./nitro-init.sh
```

### Importing the key materials

The following script was executed once on `earlgrey_a0_000` (the key initialized with `scsh3gui`) with `OP=wrap-key` to dump the test/dev keys as wrapped by the DKEK (ie: in encrypted form).  The script was then executed on each of the additional keys with `OP=unwrap-key` to import the wrapped keys into each of the NitroKeys.

`nitro-import-export.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
declare -A keys=(
    [earlgrey_a0_test_0]=1
    [earlgrey_a0_dev_0]=2
)

# Valid OPs: unwrap-key, wrap-key
: ${OP:=unwrap-key}
: ${PIN:=123456}

for k in "${!keys[@]}"; do
    kref="${keys[$k]}"
    sc-hsm-tool "--${OP}" "${k}.bin" --key-reference ${kref} --pin ${PIN}
done
```

For each key, the script was executed as follows:
```bash
# First, export keys from earlgrey_a0_000.
$ OP=wrap-key PIN=xxxxxx ./nitro-import-export.sh

# Then, for each additional NitroKey, import the wrapped keys.
$ OP=unwrap-key PIN=yyyyyy ./nitro-import-export.sh
```

# End of Day

The RAM disk contents were destroyed:
```bash
$ rm -rf /dev/shm/cfrantz
```

Nitrokeys `earlgrey_a0_000` through `earlgrey_a0_006` were initialized.
- cfrantz holds `earlgrey_a0_000`.
- ttrippel holds `earlgrey_a0_001`.
- Keys 002 - 006 were sealed into evidence bag KK2917762.
