# Cores

Cores in OpenTitan are processing units that can run programs.

Currently, there are two cores in OpenTitan:
* [Ibex](../ip/rv_core_ibex/README.md) (RV32IMCB)
* [OTBN](../ip/otbn/README.md) (programmable coprocessor for asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, 256-bit datapath)

Since cores are the interface between hardware and software, please also consult the [software resources](../../sw/README.md).
