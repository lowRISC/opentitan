            Basic I2C sanity test in which random (rd/wr) transactions are sent to the DUT 
            and received asynchronously with scoreboard checks.

            Stimulus:
              - Enable I2C host
              - Clear/Enable interrupt (if needed)
              - Program OVRD, FDATA register
              - Randomize I2C timing in TIMING 0-4 registers and other parameters such as TL agent delays
              - Randomize address and data for read/write transactions sent to the device

            Checking:
              - Check the timing behavior of START, STOP, ACK, NACK, and "repeated" START
              - Read and write transfer matching
