  one_paragraph_desc: '''
  The secure DMA controller provides OpenTitan with the ability to move data blobs securely in and out of the OpenTitan memory while offloading the Ibex core to focus on security critical tasks.
  The secure DMA provides an hardware isolation layer between OpenTitan and the rest of the SoC.
  It provides the hardware enforcement of security properties through well defined isolation & access control techniques, hardware based checking and other protection mechanisms.
  Note that depending upon use case, it is expected that the SoC provides proper security mechanisms for code / data protections such as access control mechanisms, encrypted (w/integrity protection) memory regions etc.
