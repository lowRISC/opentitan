  HMAC Accelerator is a keyed hash based message authentication code generator using [SHA-2 256/384/512][nist-fips-180-4] to check the integrity of an incoming message and optionally a signature signed with the same secret key.
  This HMAC implementation is not hardened against side-channel analysis (SCA) or fault injection (FI) attacks; it is meant purely for hashing acceleration.
  If hardened MAC operations are required, either the KMAC Accelerator or a software implementation should be used.

                This is a 6-bit one-hot encoded field to configure the key length for HMAC.

                The HMAC can be programmed with the following key lengths: 128-bit, 256-bit, 384-bit, 512-bit and 1024-bit.
                But the HMAC supports any arbitrary key length: the software should configure the HMAC with the next largest supported key length and concatenate zeros to reach the programmed key length.
                The position of these zeros depends on the endianness, thus on the programmed [`CFG.key_swap`](registers.md#cfg--key_swap).
                For example, for an 80-bit key, HMAC should be configured with an 128-bit key length, fed with the 80-bit key and with 48 zero-bits.

                Note that the key length cannot be greater than the block size: up to 1024-bit for SHA-2 384/512 and up to 512-bit for SHA-2 256.
                The value of this register is irrelevant when only SHA-2 (not keyed HMAC) is configured.
                However, for HMAC mode (`hmac_en == 1`), when HMAC is triggered to start while !!KEY_LENGTH holds `Key_None` or !!KEY_LENGTH holds `Key_1024` for !!DIGEST_SIZE = `SHA2_256`, starting is blocked and an error is signalled to SW.

            If CPU writes a value into the register, the value is used to clear the internal variables such as the secret key, internal state machine, or hash value.
            The clear secret operation overwrites the internal variables with the provided 32-bit value.
            For SHA-2 384/512 that work with 64-bit words, the 32-bit value is duplicated and concatenated to generate the 64-bit value.
            It is recommended to use a value extracted from an entropy source.

              HMAC using SHA-2 256/384/512 assumes any hashed secret key length up to the block size, thus capped at 1024-bit.

              key[1023:0] = {KEY0, KEY1, KEY2, ... , KEY31};

              The registers are allowed to be updated only when the engine is in Idle state.
              If the engine computes the hash, it discards any attempts to update the secret keys and report an error.
