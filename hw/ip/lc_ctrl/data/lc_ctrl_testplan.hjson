            Smoke test accessing lc_ctrl state transition datapath.

            **Stimulus**:
            - Initialize lc_ctrl by sending pwrmgr req and otp_ctrl valid random data.
            - Request a valid next LC state by writing CSRs: `transition_target`,
              `transition_token*`, and `transition_cmd`.

            **Checks**:
            - After lc_ctrl initialization finishes, check lc_ctrl broadcast outputs, check
              the value of lc_state and lc_transition_cnt CSRs, and check device_id and id_state
              CSRs.
            - After lc_ctrl state transition request, check status to ensure the transition is
              valid and successful.
            - Check token matching for both conditional and unconditional requests.
            - Once the transition is successful, check lc_ctrl broadcast outputs are all turned
              off.
