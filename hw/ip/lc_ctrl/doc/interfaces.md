| LC_CTRL.TRANSITION.CONFIG.REGWEN   | The transition interface registers are REGWEN protected. The REGWEN is governed by hardware, and is only set to 1 if the interface mutex has been successfully claimed. Also, the REGWEN is set to 0 while a state transition is in progress in order to prevent any accidental changes to the transition interface CSRs during that phase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| LC_CTRL.MANUF.STATE.SPARSE         | The manufacturing state vector is sparsely encoded. Although the encoding is randomly chosen, it satisfies specific Hamming weight and Hamming distance thresholds (see lc_ctrl_state_pkg.sv for the statistics). All manufacturing state encodings (except for the RAW state) have been constructed so that all OTP words belonging to the manufacturing state vector have a non-zero value. The individual OTP words are unique and have been engineered so that each word can be incrementally overwritten with another engineered value without causing the ECC bits added by the OTP macro to become inconsistent. |
| LC_CTRL.TRANSITION.CTR.SPARSE      | The life cycle transition counter state is sparsely encoded. Although the encoding is randomly chosen, it satisfies specific Hamming weight and Hamming distance thresholds (see lc_ctrl_state_pkg.sv for the statistics). All counter state encodings (except for the 0 state) have been constructed so that all OTP words belonging to the counter state vector have a non-zero value. The individual OTP words are unique and have been engineered so that each word can be incrementally overwritten with another engineered value without causing the ECC bits added by the OTP macro to become inconsistent.      |
| LC_CTRL.MANUF.STATE.BKGN_CHK       | The manufacturing state vector is continuously decoded and checked, once the life cycle controller has initialized. If any mismatch is detected, local escalation is triggered (MAIN.FSM.LOCAL_ESC).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| LC_CTRL.TRANSITION.CTR.BKGN_CHK    | The life cycle transition counter is continuously decoded and checked, once the life cycle controller has initialized. If any mismatch is detected, local escalation is triggered (MAIN.FSM.LOCAL_ESC). Note that any non-RAW manufacturing state requires the transition counter to be nonzero. Also, the transition counter is used to enforce a limit of maximum 24 state transitions in order to guard against bruteforcing.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| LC_CTRL.STATE.CONFIG.SPARSE        | The decoded manufacturing state uses a replicated enum encoding to fill the 32bit value exposed in the CSRs (both the LC_STATE and TRANSITION_TARGET registers). This is done to 1) ease hardening of firmware code, and 2) to ensure that even the decoded life cycle state vector inside the life cycle controller still has a redundant encoding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Power Manager Interface

The power manager interface is comprised of three signals overall: an initialization request (`pwr_lc_i.lc_init`), an initialization done response (`pwr_lc_o.lc_done`) and an idle indicator (`pwr_lc_o.lc_idle`).

The power manager asserts `pwr_lc_i.lc_init` in order to signal to the life cycle controller that it can start initialization, and the life cycle controller signals completion of the initialization sequence by asserting `pwr_lc_o.lc_done` (the signal will remain high until reset).

The idle indication signal `pwr_lc_o.lc_idle` indicates that the life cycle controller is idle.
If this bit is 0, the life cycle controller is either not initialized or in the middle of carrying out a life cycle state transition.
The power manager uses that indication to determine whether a power down request needs to be aborted.

Since the power manager may run in a different clock domain, the `pwr_lc_i.lc_init` signal is synchronized within the life cycle controller.
The power manager is responsible for synchronizing the `pwr_lc_o.lc_done` and `pwr_lc_o.lc_idle` signals.

See also [power manager documentation](../../../top_earlgrey/ip_autogen/pwrmgr/README.md).

#### OTP Interfaces

All interfaces to and from OTP are explained in detail in the [OTP Specification Document](../../otp_ctrl/README.md#life-cycle-interfaces).

#### KMAC Interface

The life cycle controller interfaces with KMAC through a [side load interface](../../kmac/README.md#keymgr-interface) in the same way as the key manager.
Since the KMAC and life cycle controller are in different clock domains, the KMAC interface signals are synchronized to the life cycle clock inside the life cycle controller.

#### Control Signal Propagation

For better security, all the [life cycle control signals](theory_of_operation.md#life-cycle-decoded-outputs-and-controls) are broadcast in multi-bit form.
The active ON state for every signal is broadcast as `4'b1010`, while the inactive OFF state is encoded as `4'b0101`.
For all life cycle signals except the escalation signal ESCALATE_EN, all values different from ON must be interpreted as OFF in RTL.
In case of ESCALATE_EN, all values different from OFF must be interpreted as ON in RTL.
To that end the functions `lc_tx_test_true_strict()`, `lc_tx_test_true_loose()`, `lc_tx_test_false_strict()` and `lc_tx_test_false_loose()` in the `lc_ctrl_pkg` must be employed unless there is a strong reason not to.
The reason must be documented and agreed at block sign-off.

Since many signals cross clock boundaries, their synchronization needs to be taken into account.
However, since the ON / OFF encoding above has been chosen such that **all bits toggle exactly once** for a transition from OFF to ON (and vice-versa), all that needs to be done is guard against metastability using a two-stage synchronizer, as illustrated below.

![Multibit Sync](../doc/lc_ctrl_multibit_sync.svg)

In other words, since each bit in the encoding flips exactly once upon an OFF -> ON or ON -> OFF transition, we can guarantee that there are no transient patterns toggling back and forth between enabling and disabling a function.
It is crucial however that the design follows the guidance above and interprets all undefined values as either ON or OFF in order to avoid issues due to staggered bits after synchronization.

Note that even though synchronization can be achieved with a simple two-stage synchronizer, designs **must** use the `prim_lc_sync` primitive.
This primitive has additional LC-specific assertions and provides a parametric amount of separately buffered copies of the life cycle signal to prevent logic optimization by the synthesis tool (buffers have a 'size_only' constraint in synthesis).
For all signals except ESCALATE_EN, it is recommended to structure the design such that at least two separately buffered copies of the life cycle signals have to be consumed in order to unlock a certain function.

#### Key Manager Interface

The `lc_keymgr_div_o` signal is a 128bit diversification constant that is output to the key manager once the life cycle controller has initialized, and is asserted at the same time as `lc_keymgr_en_o`.
Depending on which group the life cycle state is in, this signal is assigned a different random netlist constant as defined in the table below.

Life Cycle State Group | Assigned Diversification Constant
-----------------------|----------------------------------
TEST_UNLOCKED\*        | `RndCnstLcKeymgrDivTestUnlocked`
DEV                    | `RndCnstLcKeymgrDivDev`
PROD, PROD_END         | `RndCnstLcKeymgrDivProduction`
RMA                    | `RndCnstLcKeymgrDivRma`
All Other States       | `RndCnstLcKeymgrDivInvalid`

Note that this signal is quasistatic.
It is hence recommended to place a max-delay constraint on it and leverage the synchronized version of `lc_keymgr_en_o` to enable any downstream register in different clock domains than the life cycle controller.
