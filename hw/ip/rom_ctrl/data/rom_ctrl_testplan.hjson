            Smoke test exercising the main features of rom_ctrl.

            **Stimulus**:
            - Create a random valid ROM image and load into memory model
            - Allow the rom check to complete
            - Perform some random memory accesses

            **Checks**:
            - Check that all data supplied to kmac is correct
            - Check that the rom checking sequence gives the expected result
            - Check that the memory accesses return expected data
