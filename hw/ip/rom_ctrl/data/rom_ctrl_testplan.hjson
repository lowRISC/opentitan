            Smoke test exercising the main features of rom_ctrl.

            **Stimulus**:
            - Create a random valid ROM where expected digest doesn't match with the KMAC digest
            image and load into memory model
            - Allow the rom check to complete
            - Perform some random memory accesses
            - Create a random valid ROM where expected digest matches with the KMAC digest
            - Repeat steps 2 and 3.

            **Checks**:
            - Check that all data supplied to kmac is correct
            - Check that the rom checking sequence gives the expected result
            - Check that the memory accesses return expected data
            - Check that pwrmgr_data_o.good is not asserted in first iteration.
            - Check that pwrmgr_data_o.good is asserted in second iteration.
            - Check that tile link accesses are blocked till pwrmgr_data_o.done is asserted.
