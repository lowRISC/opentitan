// This testplan is auto-generated only the first time it is created. This is
// because this testplan needs to be hand-editable. It is possible that these
// testpoints can go out of date if the spec is updated with new
// countermeasures. When `reggen` is invoked when this testplan already exists,
// It checks if the list of testpoints is up-to-date and enforces the user to
// make further manual updates.

// These countermeasures and their descriptions can be found here:

//
// It is possible that the testing of some of these countermeasures may already
// be covered as a testpoint in a different testplan. This duplication is ok -
// the test would have likely already been developed. We simply map those tests
// to the testpoints below using the `tests` key.

             Once rom_ctrl has handed control of the mux to the bus, the internal FSM counter should
             point at the top of ROM. The unexpected_counter_change signal in rom_ctrl_fsm goes high
             and generates a fatal alert if that counter is perturbed in any way. To test this,
             addr_q in the counter is corrupted with any value other than the ROM's top address.'''
