// A counter module that drives the ROM accesses from the checker.
//
// This module doesn't need state hardening: an attacker that glitches its behaviour can stall the
// chip or read ROM data in the wrong order. Assuming we've picked a key for the ROM that ensures
// all words have different values, exploiting a glitch in this module to hide a ROM modification
// would still need a pre-image attack on SHA-3.
//
// RomDepth is the number of words in the ROM. RomTopCount is the number of those words (at the top
// of the address space) that are considered part of the expected hash.
//
// When it comes out of reset, the module starts reading from address zero. Once the reading is
// done, it will signal done_o. The surrounding (hardened) design should check that done_o never has
// a high -> low transition.
//
// The read_addr_o signal should be connected to the stateful mux that controls access to ROM. This
// mux gives access to the rom_ctrl_counter until done_o is asserted. The data_addr_o signal gives
// the address of the ROM word that was just read.
//
// The data_* signals are used to handshake with KMAC, although the surrounding FSM will step in
// once we've got to the top of memory. The counter uses the output buffer on the ROM instance to
// hold data and drives rom_addr_o and data_vld_o to make a rdy/vld interface with the ROM output.
// This interface should signal things correctly until done_o goes high. data_last_nontop_o is set
// on the last word before the top RomTopCount words.
