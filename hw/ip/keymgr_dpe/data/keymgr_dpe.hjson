        Software and sideload keys are redundantly controlled. Each generate operation

        In order for a key to be populated into the software register, both the software valid
        and the software data enable must be asserted.  The same is true for sideload.

        This makes it more difficult for an attack to fault a sideload key into the software key slot.
        An attacker would need to fault both the software valid and the software data enable.

        During a sideload operation, if an attacker manages to fault the valid but not the data enable,
        the software key is populated with random data.  If an atacker manages to fault the data enable but
        not the valid, then the software key retains its previous value.
