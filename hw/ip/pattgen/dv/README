# UART IP Verification Environment
UART IP verification environment is extended from the [Comportable IP
verification environment](/hw/dv/sv/cip_lib/README.md) to leverage a lot of common
code shared across all IPs that adhere to the
[Comportable IP](/doc/rm/ComportabilitySpecification.md) specification.
