            Test the software-controlled FIFO reset functionality, introduced as a contingency
            for error recovery and to permit reconfiguration of the USB device hardware without
            resorting to use of the block-level asynchronous reset.

            - Populate the USBDEV FIFOs with packets randomly.
            - Choose a random set of FIFOs to reset.
            - Check the FIFO levels match expectations.
            - Note: the handling of the Received Buffer FIFO requires configuration of,
              and transmission of packets to, the USB device since there is no direct means
              to inject packets from the CSR side.
