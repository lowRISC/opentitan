  Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) Controller provides a simple front-end to an analog block that allows filtering and debouncing of the sampled data.
  ADC Controller supports 2 ADC channels and 8 filters on the values from the channels.
  It has debounce timers on the filter output and supports ADCs with 10-bit output.
  To enable usage while the device is sleeping, it runs on a slow always-on clock.
  In addition, it has a low power periodic scan mode for monitoring ADC channels.
