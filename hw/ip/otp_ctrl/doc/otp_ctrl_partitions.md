SOC_DBG_STATE: Multibit enable value for the SOC debug authorization. Note that this is a field that will be written twice in a device lifetime. The values to be written are engineered in the same way as the LC_CTRL state encoding words so that the ECC encoding remains valid even after writing the second value on top of the first. The constants can be found in the lc_ctrl_state_pkg.sv package. Encoding: - SOC_DBG_RAW: this value is all-zeroes and will be the NOP state; the LC controller will take precedence. - SOC_DBG_PRE_PROD: this is where the ROT will be in PROD state but SOC will be in the pre-production unlock state - SOC_DBG_PROD: this is the state where the SOC moves to production & now the challenge-response based authentication protocol is required to unlock SOC debug features The programming order has to adhere to: SOC_DBG_RAW (factory all-zero state) -> SOC_DBG_PRE_PROD -> SOC_DBG_PROD. |

This partition cannot be locked as the life cycle state needs to be able to advance to RMA in-field. Note that while this partition is not marked secret (i.e. it is not scrambled) it is not readable nor writeable via the DAI. Only the LC controller can access this partition, and even via the LC controller it is not possible to read the raw manufacturing life cycle state in encoded form, since that encoding is considered a netlist secret. The LC controller only exposes a decoded version of this state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
