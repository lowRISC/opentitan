This partition cannot be locked as the life cycle state needs to be able to advance to RMA in-field. Note that while this partition is not marked secret (i.e. it is not scrambled) it is not readable nor writeable via the DAI. Only the LC controller can access this partition, and even via the LC controller it is not possible to read the raw manufacturing life cycle state in encoded form, since that encoding is considered a netlist secret. The LC controller only exposes a decoded version of this state. |
