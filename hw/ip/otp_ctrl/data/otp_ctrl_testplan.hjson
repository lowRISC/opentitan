            Basic wake_up test walks through otp_ctrl's power-on initialization, read, program, and
            digest functionalities.

            - Drive pwrmgr's request pin to trigger OTP initialization after reset, check status
              after OTP initialization
            - Write all-ones to a random address within OTP partition 0, wait until this operation
              completes
            - Read out the random selected write address, check if the readout value is all-ones
            - Trigger a digest calculation for a Software partition, check if the OtpError
              interrupt is set
            - Trigger a digest calculation for a non-software partition, expect operation completes
              without the OtpError interrupt
            - Read out secrets through the hardware interfaces
