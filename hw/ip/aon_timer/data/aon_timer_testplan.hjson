            Smoke test initializes and starts AON Timer according to

            - If we are changing WDOG_BARK_THOLD to be lower than the current WDOG_COUNT
            watchdog timer should raise the interrupt `wdog_timer_bark`.
            - If we are changing WDOG_BITE_THOLD to be lower than the current WDOG_COUNT
            watchdog timer should trigger a reset request.
            - If we are changing WKUP_THOLD to be lower than the current WKUP_COUNT
            wakeup timer should raise the interrupt `wkup_timer_expired`.
