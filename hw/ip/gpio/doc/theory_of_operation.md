The block diagram above shows the `DATA_OUT` and `DATA_OE` registers
managed by hardware outside of the auto-generated register file.
For reference, it also shows the assumed connections to pads in
the top level netlist.

## Design Details

### GPIO Output logic

![GPIO Output Diagram](../doc/gpio_output.svg)

The GPIO module maintains one 32-bit output register `DATA_OUT` with two
ways to write to it. Direct write access uses [`DIRECT_OUT`](registers.md#direct_out), and
masked access uses [`MASKED_OUT_UPPER`](registers.md#masked_out_upper) and
[`MASKED_OUT_LOWER`](registers.md#masked_out_lower). Direct access provides full write and read
access for all 32 bits in one register.

For masked access the bits to modify are given as a mask in the upper
16 bits of the [`MASKED_OUT_UPPER`](registers.md#masked_out_upper) and
[`MASKED_OUT_LOWER`](registers.md#masked_out_lower) register write, while the data to write is
provided in the lower 16 bits of the register write.  The hardware updates
`DATA_OUT` with the mask so that the modification is done without software
requiring a Read-Modify-Write.

Reads of masked registers return the lower/upper 16 bits of the `DATA_OUT`
contents. Zeros are returned in the upper 16 bits (mask field). To read
what is on the pins, software should read the [`DATA_IN`](registers.md#data_in) register.
(See [GPIO Input](#gpio-input) section below).

The same concept is duplicated for the output enable register `DATA_OE`.
Direct access uses [`DIRECT_OE`](registers.md#direct_oe), and masked access is available
using [`MASKED_OE_UPPER`](registers.md#masked_oe_upper) and [`MASKED_OE_LOWER`](registers.md#masked_oe_lower).

The output enable is sent to the pad control block to determine if the
pad should drive the `DATA_OUT` value to the associated pin or not.

A typical use pattern is for initialization and suspend/resume code to
use the full access registers to set the output enables and current output
values, then switch to masked access for both `DATA_OUT` and `DATA_OE`.

For GPIO outputs that are not used (either not wired to a pin output or
not selected for pin multiplexing), the output values are disconnected
and have no effect on the GPIO input, regardless of output enable values.

### GPIO Input

The [`DATA_IN`](registers.md#data_in) register returns the contents as seen on the
peripheral input, typically from the pads connected to those inputs.  In the
presence of a pin-multiplexing unit, GPIO peripheral inputs that are
not connected to a chip input will be tied to a constant zero input.

The GPIO module provides optional independent noise filter control for
each of the 32 input signals. Each input can be independently enabled with
the [`CTRL_EN_INPUT_FILTER`](registers.md#ctrl_en_input_filter) (one bit per input).  This 16-cycle
filter is applied to both the [`DATA_IN`](registers.md#data_in) register and
the interrupt detection logic. The timing for [`DATA_IN`](registers.md#data_in) is still
not instantaneous if [`CTRL_EN_INPUT_FILTER`](registers.md#ctrl_en_input_filter) is false as there is
top-level routing involved, but no flops are between the chip input and the
[`DATA_IN`](registers.md#data_in) register.

The contents of [`DATA_IN`](registers.md#data_in) are always readable and reflect the
value seen at the chip input pad regardless of the output enable setting from
DATA_OE. If the output enable is true (and the GPIO is connected to a
chip-level pad), the value read from [`DATA_IN`](registers.md#data_in) includes the
effect of the peripheral's driven output (so will only differ from DATA_OUT if
the output driver is unable to switch the pin or during the delay imposed
if the noise filter is enabled).

### Interrupts

The GPIO module provides 32 interrupt signals to the main processor.
Each interrupt can be independently enabled, tested, and configured.
Following the standard interrupt guidelines in the [Comportability
Specification](../../../../doc/contributing/hw/comportability/README.md),
the 32 bits of the [`INTR_ENABLE`](registers.md#intr_enable) register determines whether the
associated inputs are configured to detect interrupt events. If enabled
via the various `INTR_CTRL_EN` registers, their current state can be
read in the [`INTR_STATE`](registers.md#intr_state) register. Clearing is done by writing a
`1` into the associated [`INTR_STATE`](registers.md#intr_state) bit field.

For configuration, there are 4 types of interrupts available per bit,
controlled with four control registers. [`INTR_CTRL_EN_RISING`](registers.md#intr_ctrl_en_rising)
configures the associated input for rising-edge detection.
Similarly, [`INTR_CTRL_EN_FALLING`](registers.md#intr_ctrl_en_falling) detects falling edge inputs.
[`INTR_CTRL_EN_LVLHIGH`](registers.md#intr_ctrl_en_lvlhigh) and [`INTR_CTRL_EN_LVLLOW`](registers.md#intr_ctrl_en_lvllow)
allow the input to be level sensitive interrupts. In theory an input can be
configured to detect both a rising and falling edge, but there is no hardware
assistance to indicate which edge caused the output interrupt.

**Note #1:** The interrupt can only be triggered by GPIO input.
**Note #2:** All inputs are sent through optional noise filtering before being sent into interrupt detection.
**Note #3:** All interrupts to the processor are level interrupts as per the Comportability Specification guidelines.
The GPIO module, if configured, converts an edge detection into a level interrupt to the processor core.
