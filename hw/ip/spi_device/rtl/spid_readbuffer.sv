// SPI Flash Read Command: Read Buffer Manager
/*
The SPI Device IP uses the first half of the DPSRAM as a read buffer. The IP
returns data from the read buffer based on the given address in the received
read command. The read buffer size is 2kB in current design. The IP only uses
lower 11 bits ($clog2(2048)) of the received read command address and uses the
address to issue the read request to the DPSRAM.

It is the SW responsibility to update the read buffer contents. Ths module
provides a SW configurable read watermark CSR and read only
`LAST_READ_ADDRESS` CSR. SW may use those registers to get the time to update
the buffer contents.

The module receives the current sent address and the threshold to determine
the buffer flip and the watermark event. Buffer flip event occurs when the
host system accesses the other side of the buffer. For example, in current
total buffer size 2kB. If the host accesses 0xFFC then 0x1000. The buffer flip
occurs (from Buffer 1 to Buffer 0). In contrast, if the host system crosses
the buffer boundary in opposite direction(0x1000 --> 0xFFC), it is not assumed
as a buffer flip event.

The watermark event happens when the host system accesses the address greater
than the watermark CSR for the first time in a buffer. Let's assume the
threshold (watermark) CSR value is 0x400 (512B). If the host system issues
a SPI read command at the address 0x3FC and read 16B data, the IP keeps
checking the sent address (from 0x3FC then 0x3FD, 0x3FE, 0x3FF) and when it
sends the 0x400 data, it raises a watermark event.

The watermark event is sticky event. It is reported to the SW once and cleared
by the flip event. So even the host system keeps reading 0x3FC and 0x400
multiple times, the event won't be notified to the SW after the first report.
