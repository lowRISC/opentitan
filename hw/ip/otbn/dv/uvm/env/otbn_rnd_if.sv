  // To cover the interaction between RND and RND_PREFETCH, we have to do some state modelling to
  // figure out what's going on. We model the following DFA:
  //
  //
  //    IDLE ---> PREFETCHING -\
  //     ^ |                   |
  //     | \----> READING <----/
  //     |           |
  //                 v
  //     \-------- FULL
  //
  // In Graphviz notation (with labels explaining the edges), that is:
  //
  //  digraph fsm {
  //    idle -> reading        [label="RD RND"]
  //    reading -> full        [label="EDN DATA"]
  //    idle -> prefetching    [label="WR RND_PREFETCH"]
  //    prefetching -> reading [label="RD RND"]
  //    prefetching -> full    [label="EDN DATA"]
  //    full -> idle           [label="RD RND"]
  //  }
  //
  // The three events that can happen are:
  //
  //  [RD RND]:          Start an instruction that reads from RND (the WSR or CSR)
  //  [EDN DATA]:        Random data arrives from the EDN
  //  [WR RND_PREFETCH]: Write to the prefetch register
  //
  // The easiest way to spot these events is to look at the ports of the otbn_rnd module. [RD RND]
  // happens when we see the rnd_req_i signal of the otbn_rnd module go high. [EDN DATA] happens
  // when edn_rnd_ack_i goes high. [WR RND_PREFETCH] happens if rnd_prefetch_req_i goes high.
  //
  // Rather than tracking the state based on these events, and possibly having it come adrift, we
  // can also snoop on some internal signals to see where we are.
  //
  //   - If rnd_valid_q is true then we are in the FULL state
  //   - If $past(rnd_req_i && !rnd_valid_q) then we are in the READING state
  //   - If edn_rnd_req_q && !$past(rnd_req_i) then we are in the PREFETCHING state
  //   - Otherwise we are in the IDLE state
  //
  // This interface uses those signals to reconstruct the current state. It also checks for the
  // events above and has assertions to make sure we step through the DFA in the way we expect. This
  // gives a bit of extra testing to the RTL but, more importantly, checks that we've understood the
  // "current state" correctly, which we need in order to define cover properties.
  //
  // Finally, the interface defines some cover properties for events that we want to see in
  // particular states.
