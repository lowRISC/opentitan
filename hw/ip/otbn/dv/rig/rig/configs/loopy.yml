# An example custom configuration that generates lots of loops (100
# times as many as the default config), but constrains them not to
# take too long. We also force the generator not to make long loop
# tails (the straight-line code that appears up to and including the
# last instruction of the loop). The idea is that we'll be much more
# likely to get deeply nested loops this way.
