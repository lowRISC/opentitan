# An custom configuration that doesn't generate any branches, and
# increases the weight for BadCallStackRW. The idea is that
# BadCallStackRW needs to know the depth of the call stack in order to
# under- or overflow it. Branches tend to make this less likely
# (because if the two sides of the branch use x1 differently, we'll
# end up with an unknown depth after the phi node), so turning them
# off makes it much more likely to work.
