    This handles anything that doesn't decode correctly. Doing so for OTBN is
    much easier than if we wanted to support compressed-mode (RV32IC), because
    we don't need to worry about whether we have 16 or 32 bits of rubbish.

    Note that we declare this with an opcode of zero. Note that this implies
    the bottom two bits are 0, which would imply a compressed instruction, so
    we know this doesn't match any real instruction.
