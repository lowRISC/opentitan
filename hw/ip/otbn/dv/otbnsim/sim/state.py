class FsmState(IntEnum):
    r'''State of the internal start/stop FSM

    The FSM diagram looks like:

        MEM_SEC_WIPE <--\
             |          |
             \-------> IDLE -> PRE_EXEC -> EXEC
                         ^                  | |
                         \-- WIPING_GOOD <--/ |
                                              |
                 LOCKED <--  WIPING_BAD  <----/

    IDLE represents the state when nothing is going on but there have been no
    fatal errors. It matches Status.IDLE. LOCKED represents the state when
    there has been a fatal error. It matches Status.LOCKED.

    MEM_SEC_WIPE only represents the state where OTBN is busy operating on
    secure wipe of DMEM/IMEM using SEC_WIPE_I(D)MEM command. Secure wipe of the
    memories also happen when we encounter a fatal error while on
    Status.BUSY_EXECUTE. However, if we are getting a fatal error Status would
    be LOCKED.

    PRE_EXEC, EXEC, WIPING_GOOD and WIPING_BAD correspond to
    Status.BUSY_EXECUTE. PRE_EXEC is the period after starting OTBN where we're
    still waiting for an EDN value to seed URND. EXEC is the period where we
    start fetching and executing instructions.

    WIPING_GOOD and WIPING_BAD represent the time where we're performing a
    secure wipe of internal state (ending in updating the STATUS register to
    show we're done). The difference between them is that WIPING_GOOD goes back
    to IDLE and WIPING_BAD goes to LOCKED.

    This is a refinement of the Status enum and the integer values are picked
    so that you can divide by 10 to get the corresponding Status entry. (This
    isn't used in the code, but makes debugging slightly more convenient when
    you just have the numeric values available).
