    title: Base Instruction Subset
    doc: |
      The base instruction set of OTBN is a limited 32b instruction set.
      It is used together with the 32b wide General Purpose Register file.
      The primary use of the base instruction set is the control flow in applications.

      The base instruction set is an extended subset of [RISC-V's RV32I_Zcsr](https://riscv.org/specifications/isa-spec-pdf/).
      Refer to the [RISC-V Unprivileged Specification](https://riscv.org/specifications/isa-spec-pdf/) for a detailed instruction specification.
      Not all RV32 instructions are implemented.
      The implemented subset is shown below.
      Many instructions in the base instruction set have an equivalent in the big number instruction subset, enabling processor logic to be shared between the instruction subsets.

      All Big Number (BN) instructions operate on the wide register file WREG.

# Instruction encoding schemes
#
# These define the mapping between instruction operands and bits in the
# encoding. A scheme names zero or more named fields. It can also inherit from
# zero or more other schemes.
#
# The direct fields of a scheme are defined as a dictionary, mapping a field
# name (which will be matched up with instruction operands) to a value. In
# general, this value is itself a dictionary with the following keys:
#
#  bits: A list of ranges of bits. A range is written <msb>-<lsb>, where both
#        are integers (and msb >= lsb). Multiple ranges can be separated by
#        commas. A degenerate range (with msb == lsb) can be written as a bare
#        integer. Required.
#
#  value: Optional. If specified, this should be a binary string for a fixed
#         value for this field, prefixed with a "b" (to avoid the YAML parser
#         reading it as a decimal number). Underscores in the string are
#         ignored (to make it easier to show grouping) and 'x' means don't
#         care.
#
#  shift: Optional. If specified, this is the number of bits to shift the
#         encoded value left to get the logical value.
#
# For brevity, if value and shift have their default values, the bits string
# can be used as the value for the field.
#
# A scheme can inherit from other schemes by listing their names in a 'parents'
# attribute. If the child scheme needs to set the value of a parents' field to
# something fixed, it can do so with the following syntax:
#
#     parent_name(field_name=b11101, field_name2=b111)
#
# The fields of a scheme are recursively defined to be its direct fields plus
# the fields all its ancestors.
#
# A scheme is called complete if its fields cover the entire range of bits
# (0-31) and partial otherwise.

# The instructions. Instructions are listed in the given order within
# each instruction group. There are the following fields:
#
#  mnemonic:  Instruction mnemonic (required)
#
#  group:     The instruction group in which this instruction should
#             appear. Defaults to the first entry in the insn-groups
#             list. (optional)
#
#  rv32i:     A boolean. If true, this instruction came from the RV32I ISA.
#             Optional, defaults to false.
#
#  synopsis:  A longer name for this instruction. If set, used as a subtitle in
#             the generated documentation. (optional)
#
#  operands:  A list of operand names. These have a special syntax, described
#             below. (required)
#
#  syntax:    The syntax for the operands to the instruction. If not given,
#             this is assumed to be the operands in order, separated by commas.
#             If given, it should be a string with operand names in angle
#             brackets ("<foo>, <bar>"). Any other non-whitespace characters
#             are taken to be required literal syntax. So "foo<bar>" means "the
#             string 'foo', followed by the bar operand".
#
#  doc:       Documentation for the instruction in markdown. (optional)
#
#  decode:    Python pseudocode for decoding instruction objects (optional)
#
#  operation: Python pseudocode for the operation of the instruction (optional)
#
#  note:      Text that should appear in a callout banner at the top of the
#             instruction documentation. (optional)
#
#  glued-ops: A boolean. If true, the first operand in the syntax can appear
#             immediately after the mnemonic (with no space). Optional,
#             defaults to false.
#
#  trailing-doc: Documentation that should appear after the syntax example but
#                before the operand table. Useful for things like alternative
#                assembly syntax, or deviations from the usual meaning of the
#                instruction. (optional)
#
# The operands field should be a list, corresponding to the operands in the
# order they will appear in the syntax. Each operand is either a string (the
# operand name) or a dictionary. In the latter case, it has the following
# fields:
#
#  name:      The name of the operand. Required and must be unique.
#
#  type:      The type of the operand. A string. If this can be figured out
#             from the operand name, it is optional. See below for a list of
#             possible operand types and the rules for recognising them
#             automatically.
#
#  doc:       A fragment of markdown that documents the operand
#
# The valid operand types are as follows:
#
#  gpr:       The name of a general purpose register. Syntax "grs" for a
#             source; "grd" for a destination.
#
#  wdr:       The name of a wide register. Syntax "wrs" for a source;
#             "wrd" for a destination.
#
#  csr:       The name of a CSR. Syntax "csr" (always considered a destination)
#
#  wsr:       The name of a WSR. Syntax "wsr" (always considered a destination)
#
#  immediate: An immediate operand. Syntax "imm<n>" where n is the number of
#             bits or just imm for an unspecified width.
#
#  enum:      An immediate with weird syntax. The syntax is "enum(a,b,c,d)"
#             where a..d are the different possible syntaxes that can be used.
#             The values are interpreted as immediates in enumeration order (so
#             a is 0; d is 3).
#
#  option:    A 1-bit immediate with weird syntax. Written "option(foo)" to
#             mean that if the string "foo" appears then the immediate has
#             value 1 and if it doesn't the immediate has value 0.
#
# Operand types are inferred from names as follows:
#
#  grd:        GPR destination
#  grs, grs<n> GPR source
#  wrd:        WDR destination
#  wrs, wrs<n> WDR source
#  csr         CSR name
#  wsr         WSR name
#  imm, imm<n> Immediate
#  offset      Immediate (unspecified width)
