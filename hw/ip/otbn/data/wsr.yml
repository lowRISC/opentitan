    The modulus used by the {{#otbn-insn-ref BN.ADDM}} and {{#otbn-insn-ref BN.SUBM}} instructions as well as their vectorized variants.
    This WSR is also visible as CSRs `MOD0` through to `MOD7`.

- name: rnd

  doc: |
    An AIS31-compliant class PTG.3 random number with guaranteed entropy and forward and backward secrecy.
    Primarily intended to be used for key generation.

    The number is sourced from the EDN via a single-entry cache.
    Reads when the cache is empty will cause OTBN to be stalled until a new random number is fetched from the EDN.

- name: urnd
  address: 2
  read-only: true
  doc: |
    A random number without guaranteed secrecy properties or specific statistical properties.
    Intended for use in masking and blinding schemes.
    Use RND for high-quality randomness.

    The number is sourced from an local PRNG.
    Reads never stall.

- name: acc
  address: 3
  doc: |
    The accumulator register used by the {{#otbn-insn-ref BN.MULQACC}} instruction and the vectorized multiplication instructions like {{#otbn-insn-ref BN.MULV}}.

    Bits [255:0] of share 0 of the 384b OTBN sideload key provided by the [Key Manager](../keymgr/README.md).

    A `KEY_INVALID` software error is raised on read if the Key Manager has not provided a valid key.

    Bits [255:128] of this register are always zero.
    Bits [127:0] contain bits [383:256] of share 0 of the 384b OTBN sideload key provided by the [Key Manager](../keymgr/README.md).

    A `KEY_INVALID` software error is raised on read if the Key Manager has not provided a valid key.

- name: kmac_data_s0

  doc: |
    KMAC_DATA_S0 is the first 256-bit share of the masked message or digest interface.

    For masked operations, provide the first share here and the second share in KMAC_DATA_S1.

    If masking is not required:
    - Set this share to the plaintext data.
    - Set the other share to all-zeros.

    The digest data is provided in chunks of 64 bits at a time.
    For plaintext retrieval of the digest, software must XOR the values from KMAC_DATA_S0 and KMAC_DATA_S1.
  bits:
    63-0: |
      Write: Least significant word of the message share.
      Read: Current 64-bit word of the digest share.
    255-64: |
      Write: Words 1-3 of the message share.
      Read: Returns `0`. Digest shares are read out via the least significant word only.
