    The modulus used by the {{#otbn-insn-ref BN.ADDM}} and {{#otbn-insn-ref BN.SUBM}} instructions.
    This WSR is also visible as CSRs `MOD0` through to `MOD7`.

- name: rnd
  address: 1
  read-only: true
  doc: |
    An AIS31-compliant class PTG.3 random number with guaranteed entropy and forward and backward secrecy.
    Primarily intended to be used for key generation.

    The number is sourced from the EDN via a single-entry cache.
    Reads when the cache is empty will cause OTBN to be stalled until a new random number is fetched from the EDN.

- name: urnd
  address: 2
  read-only: true
  doc: |
    A random number without guaranteed secrecy properties or specific statistical properties.
    Intended for use in masking and blinding schemes.
    Use RND for high-quality randomness.

    The number is sourced from an local PRNG.
    Reads never stall.

- name: acc
  address: 3
  doc: |
    The accumulator register used by the {{#otbn-insn-ref BN.MULQACC}} instruction.

- name: key_s0_l
  address: 4
  read-only: true
  doc: |
    Bits [255:0] of share 0 of the 384b OTBN sideload key provided by the [Key Manager](../keymgr/README.md).

    A `KEY_INVALID` software error is raised on read if the Key Manager has not provided a valid key.

- name: key_s0_h
  address: 5
  read-only: true
  doc: |
    Bits [255:128] of this register are always zero.
    Bits [127:0] contain bits [383:256] of share 0 of the 384b OTBN sideload key provided by the [Key Manager](../keymgr/README.md).

    A `KEY_INVALID` software error is raised on read if the Key Manager has not provided a valid key.

    Bits [255:0] of share 1 of the 384b OTBN sideload key provided by the [Key Manager](../keymgr/README.md).

    A `KEY_INVALID` software error is raised on read if the Key Manager has not provided a valid key.
