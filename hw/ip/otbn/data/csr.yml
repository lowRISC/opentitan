    Write to this CSR to begin a request to fill the RND cache.
    Always reads as 0.

- name: rnd
  address: 0xfc0
  read-only: true
  doc: |
    An AIS31-compliant class PTG.3 random number with guaranteed entropy and forward and backward secrecy.
    Primarily intended to be used for key generation.

    The number is sourced from the EDN via a single-entry cache.
    Reads when the cache is empty will cause OTBN to be stalled until a new random number is fetched from the EDN.

- name: urnd
  address: 0xfc1
  read-only: true
  doc: |
    A random number without guaranteed secrecy properties or specific statistical properties.
    Intended for use in masking and blinding schemes.
    Use RND for high-quality randomness.

    The number is sourced from an local PRNG.
    Reads never stall.
