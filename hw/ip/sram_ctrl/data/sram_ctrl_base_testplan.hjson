            In this test we iterate through each address in the SRAM memory.
            For each address write the current address to the SRAM.

            After this is done, read every address and check that the stored data is equivalent to
            the current address.

            This will verify that the SRAM encryption mechanism is actually bijective, and will not
            cause any address collisions.

            e.g. if the encryption scheme causes addresses 0x1 and 0x2 to collide and we write 0x1
                 and 0x2 respectively, we will see a return value of 0x2 when we read from 0x1,
                 instead of the expected 0x1.

            This process will be repeated for a number of new key seeds.

            This test is intended to test the "execute from SRAM" feature, in which TLUL memory
            transactions tagged with the `InstrType` value in the user bits are allowed to be
            handled by the SRAM memory.

            This behavior is enabled by either setting the `exec` CSR to 1 or by driving a second
            lifecycle input to `On` - both of these are muxed between with a `otp_en_sram_ifetch_i`
            input from the OTP controller.

            If this functionality is disabled, any memory transaction NOT tagged as `DataType` should
            error out, however `DataType` transactions should be successful when the SRAM is
            configured to be executable.
