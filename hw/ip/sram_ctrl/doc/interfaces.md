### Interfaces to OTP and the SRAM Scrambling Primitive

The interface to the key derivation interface inside the OTP controller follows a simple req / ack protocol, where the SRAM controller first requests an updated ephemeral key by asserting the `sram_otp_key_i.req`.
The OTP controller then fetches entropy from CSRNG and derives an ephemeral key using the SRAM_DATA_KEY_SEED and the PRESENT scrambling data path as described in the [OTP controller spec](../../otp_ctrl/README.md#scrambling-datapath).
Finally, the OTP controller returns a fresh ephemeral key via the response channels (`sram_otp_key_o[*]`, `otbn_otp_key_o`), which complete the req / ack handshake.
The key and nonce are made available to the scrambling primitive in the subsequent cycle.
The wave diagram below illustrates this process.

```wavejson
{signal: [
  {name: 'clk_otp_i',                 wave: 'p...........'},
  {name: 'sram_otp_key_o.req',        wave: '0.|1.|..0|..'},
  {name: 'sram_otp_key_i.ack',        wave: '0.|..|.10|..'},
  {name: 'sram_otp_key_i.nonce',      wave: '0.|..|.30|..'},
  {name: 'sram_otp_key_i.key',        wave: '0.|..|.30|..'},
  {name: 'sram_otp_key_i.seed_valid', wave: '0.|..|.10|..'},
  {},
  {name: 'clk_i',                     wave: 'p...........'},
  {name: 'key_valid_q',               wave: '10|..|...|1.'},
  {name: 'key_q',                     wave: '4.|..|...|3.'},
  {name: 'nonce_q',                   wave: '4.|..|...|3.'},
  {name: 'key_seed_valid_q',          wave: '4.|..|...|3.'},
]}
```

If the key seeds have not yet been provisioned in OTP, the keys are derived from all-zero constants, and the `*.seed_valid` signal will be set to 0 in the response.
It should be noted that this mechanism requires the CSRNG and entropy distribution network to be operational, and a key derivation request will block if they are not.

Note that the req/ack protocol runs on `clk_otp_i`.
The SRAM controller synchronizes the data over via a req/ack handshake primitive `prim_sync_reqack.sv` primitive as shown below.

![OTP Key Req Ack](../../otp_ctrl/doc/otp_ctrl_key_req_ack.svg)

Note that the key and nonce output signals on the OTP controller side are guaranteed to remain stable for at least 62 OTP clock cycles after the `ack` signal is pulsed high, because the derivation of a 64bit half-key takes at least two passes through the 31-cycle PRESENT primitive.
Hence, if the SRAM controller clock `clk_i` is faster or in the same order of magnitude as `clk_otp_i`, the data can be directly sampled upon assertion of `src_ack_o`.
If the SRAM controller runs on a significantly slower clock than OTP, an additional register (as indicated with dashed grey lines in the figure) has to be added.

### Global and Local Escalation

If `lc_escalate_en_i` is set to any different value than `lc_ctrl_pkg::Off`, the current scrambling keys are discarded and reset to `RndCnstSramKey` and `RndCnstSramNonce` in the subsequent cycle.
Any subsequent memory request to `prim_ram_1p_scr` will then be blocked as well.
This mechanism is part of the [life cycle](../../lc_ctrl/README.md) state scrapping and secret wiping countermeasure triggered by the alert handler (global escalation).

Note that if any local bus integrity or counter errors are detected, the SRAM controller will locally escalate without assertion of `lc_escalate_en_i`.
The behavior of local escalation is identical to global escalation via `lc_escalate_en_i`.
