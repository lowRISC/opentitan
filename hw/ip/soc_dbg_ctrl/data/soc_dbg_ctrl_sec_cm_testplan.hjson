// Security countermeasures testplan extracted from the IP Hjson using reggen.
//
// This testplan is auto-generated only the first time it is created. This is
// because this testplan needs to be hand-editable. It is possible that these
// testpoints can go out of date if the spec is updated with new
// countermeasures. When `reggen` is invoked when this testplan already exists,
// It checks if the list of testpoints is up-to-date and enforces the user to
// make further manual updates.
//
// These countermeasures and their descriptions can be found here:
// .../soc_dbg_ctrl/data/soc_dbg_ctrl.hjson
//
// It is possible that the testing of some of these countermeasures may already
// be covered as a testpoint in a different testplan. This duplication is ok -
// the test would have likely already been developed. We simply map those tests
// to the testpoints below using the `tests` key.
//
// Please ensure that this testplan is imported in:
// .../soc_dbg_ctrl/data/soc_dbg_ctrl_testplan.hjson
