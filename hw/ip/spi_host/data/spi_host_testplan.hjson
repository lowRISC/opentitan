            SPI_HOST smoke test in which random (rd/wr) transactions are sent to the DUT and
            received asynchronously with scoreboard checks.

            Stimulus:
              - Enable spi_host ip
              - Clear/enable interrupt (if needed)
              - Program configuration registers (CONTROL) to reset spi_fsm, reset/set watermark for the fifos
              - Program the CONFIGOPTS register to config spi_host channel
                operating in different modes (single, dual, or quad)
              - Randomize the content of COMMAND register
              - Program/retrive data in TXDATA/RXDATA register w.r.t transmitted/received transactions

            Checking:
              - Ensure transactions are transmitted/received correctly
