# The location of running XBAR simulation
Don't run xbar simulation in the current directory: `hw/ip/tlul/generic_dv`.
Currently directory only contains the generic portion of the xbar TB, which is
used by all flavors of xbar. The simulation directory is along with actual xbar
design, for example:
* hw/top_earlgrey/ip/xbar_main/dv/autogen
* hw/top_earlgrey/ip/xbar_peri/dv/autogen
