## Block Diagram

![Timer Block Diagram](../doc/timer_block_diagram.svg)

The timer module is composed of tick generators, counters, and comparators.
A tick generator creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the
[`CFG0.prescaler`](../../spi_device/data/spi_device.hjson#cfg0) value. The tick is used to increment `mtime` by the [`CFG0.step`](../../spi_device/data/spi_device.hjson#cfg0)
value. The 64-bit `mtime` value is compared with the 64-bit `mtimecmp`. If
`mtime` is greater than or equal to `mtimecmp`, the timer raises an interrupt.

## Design Details

### Tick Generator

The tick module inside the timer IP is used to generate a fixed period of pulse
signal. This allows creation of a call-clock timer tick such as 1us or 10us
regardless of the system clock period. It is useful if the system has more than
one clock as a clock source. The firmware just needs to adjust the
[`CFG0.prescaler`](../../spi_device/data/spi_device.hjson#cfg0) value and the actual timer interrupt handling routine does not
need a variable clock period to update `mtimecmp`.

For instance, if a system switches between 48MHz and 200MHz clocks, a prescaler
value of **47** for 48MHz and **199** for 200MHz will generate a 1us tick.
In this version, the timer only supports a single fixed clock, so the firmware
should change [`CFG0.prescaler`](../../spi_device/data/spi_device.hjson#cfg0) appropriately.

### Configurable number of timers and harts

The timer IP supports more than one HART and/or more than one timer per hart.
Each hart has a set of tick generator and counter. It means the timer IP has the
same number of prescalers, steps, and `mtime` registers as the number of harts.

Each hart can have multiple sets of `mtimecmp`, comparator logic, and expire
interrupt signals. This version of the IP is fixed to have one Hart and one
Timer per Hart.

Below is an example configuration file for `N_TIMER` 2 and `N_HARTS` 2.
It has separate interrupts per timer and a set of interrupt enable and state
registers per Hart.
