# Ibex RISC-V Core

Ibex is a small and efficient, 32-bit, in-order RISC-V core with a 2-stage pipeline that implements
the RV32IMC instruction set architecture.

<p align="center"><img src="doc/images/blockdiagram.svg" width="650"></p>

Ibex offers several configuration parameters to meet the needs of various application scenarios.
The options include two different choices for the architecture of the multiplier and divider unit,
as well as the possibility to drop the support for the "M" extension completely. In addition, the
"E" extension can be enabled when opting for a minimum-area configuration.

This core was initially developed as part of the [PULP platform](https://www.pulp-platform.org)
under the name "Zero-riscy" \[[1](https://doi.org/10.1109/PATMOS.2017.8106976)\], and has been
contributed to [lowRISC](https://www.lowrisc.org) who maintains it and develops it further. It is
under active development, with further code cleanups, feature additions, and test and verification
planned for the future.

## Documentation

The Ibex user manual can be
[read online at ReadTheDocs](https://ibex-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is also contained in
