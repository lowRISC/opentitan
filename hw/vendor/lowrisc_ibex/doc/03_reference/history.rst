History
=======

Ibex development started in 2015 under the name "Zero-riscy" as part of the `PULP platform <https://pulp-platform.org>`_ for energy-efficient computing.
Much of the code was developed by simplifying the RV32 CPU core "RI5CY" to demonstrate how small a RISC-V CPU core could actually be `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1109/PATMOS.2017.8106976>`_.
To make it even smaller, support for the "E" extension was added under the code name "Micro-riscy".
In the PULP ecosystem, the core is used as the control core for PULP, PULPino and PULPissimo.

In December 2018 lowRISC took over the development of Zero-riscy and renamed it to Ibex.
