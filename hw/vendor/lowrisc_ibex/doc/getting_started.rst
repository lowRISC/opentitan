Getting Started with Ibex
=========================

This page discusses initial steps and requirements to start using Ibex in your design.

Register File
-------------

Ibex comes with two different register file implementations.
Depending on the target technology, either the implementation in ``ibex_register_file_ff.sv`` or the one in ``ibex_register_file_latch.sv`` should be selected.
For more information about the two register file implementations and their trade-offs, check out :ref:`register-file`.
