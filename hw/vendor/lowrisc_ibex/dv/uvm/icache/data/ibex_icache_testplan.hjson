            Make a series of requests with unconstrained addresses, branching
            occasionally and disabling the request line occasionally (modelling
            the core going to sleep). Toggle whether the cache is enabled.
            Invalidate the cache very occasionally.

            Self-checking performed as described in the DV plan (the same
            self-check tests are run for all the tests described below, as well
            as any extra tests they describe).'''

            Randomly pick a base address and then constrain all branch targets
            to lie within 64 bytes of the base address and all runs of
            instructions to at most 100 instructions (totalling at most 400
            bytes of code). Leave the cache disabled and make memory seed
            changes reasonably frequent.

            If any data is wrongly cached, the scoreboard in this test should
            probably spot it happening. Note that the smoke test theoretically
            could check this, but the unconstrained branch addresses mean it's
            very unlikely to see much caching going on.'''

            reset has finished), start fetching and check that most results are
            cached by counting transactions on the instruction bus versus

            back to a few bytes before the address where we started. Repeat.

            Since the initial branch target needn't lie at the start of a cache
            line, this will stress-test the logic that the cache has for filling
            lines (it starts at the requested word, runs to the top of the line,
            and then goes back to the start to get what it missed). This will
