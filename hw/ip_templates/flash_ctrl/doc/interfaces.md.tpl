| fatal_err              | Flash fatal errors including uncorrectable ECC errors. Note that this alert is not always fatal. The underlying error bits in the [`FAULT_STATUS`](registers.md#fault_status) register remain set until reset, meaning the alert keeps firing. This doesn't hold for [`FAULT_STATUS.PHY_RELBL_ERR`](registers.md#fault_status) and [`FAULT_STATUS.PHY_STORAGE_ERR.`](registers.md#fault_status) To enable firmware dealing with multi-bit ECC and ICV errors during firmware selection and verification, these error bits can be cleared. After passing this stage, it is recommended that firmware classifies the corresponding alert as fatal on the receiver end, i.e, inside the alert handler. |
