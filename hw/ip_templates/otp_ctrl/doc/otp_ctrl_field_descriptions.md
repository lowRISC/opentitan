This field consists of a contiguous 64-byte block, or an array of four 128-bit fields. Each 128-bit subfield encodes four 32-bit words that contain the alert phase cycle count configurations for alert escalation phases 0 to 3, from LSW to MSW. Each 128-bit subfield is contains all cofigurations for a single alert class, arranged from class A to D, from LS to MS. For example, the cycle durations of each escalation phase in this field should be configured as such, from LSB to MSB: <classA,phase0>...<classA,phase3>...<classD,phase0>... <classD,phase3>.

See the READBACK CSR of the sram_ctrl for more details on this feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The validation check is a hardening mechanism that checks the reset reasons for consistency at two different points in time. Both packed values should be the same.

A value of kHardenedBoolTrue allows the ROM to use an the exception handler that recovers gracefully and continues the boot process if a flash ECC error is encountered during verification of a specific ROM_EXT slot. This enables the ROM to attempt booting the next ROM_EXT slot if the first slot attempted has been corrupted. All other values trigger default ROM exception handling, which is all exceptions trigger a chip shutdown and reset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
