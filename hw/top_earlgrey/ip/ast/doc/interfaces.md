# Interface Signals

## Table notes

### Signal naming conventions used in this document

Naming here is compliant with the OpenTitan [names](https://github.com/lowRISC/style-guides/blob/master/VerilogCodingStyle.md#naming) and [suffixes](https://github.com/lowRISC/style-guides/blob/master/VerilogCodingStyle.md#suffixes) specification, with the following augmentations:

- Clock signals start with `clk_*`
- Inputs and outputs are marked with `*_i/o`
- Analog signals are marked with `*_a`
- Non-core level signals are marked with `*_h`
- Dual and negative polarity signals are marked with `*_p/n`

### Clock domains column

| sys   | Up to 100MHz | jittery system clock. Mainly used for high performance and security modules.            |
| usb   | 48MHz        | USB module source clock.                                                                |
| aon   | 200kHz       | Always-on domain clock. The only active clock while chip is in deep-sleep power states. |
| async |              | *It does not matter what domain drives the signal*                                      |

- Input clocks: Each functional interface has a dedicated clock named after the interface.

It is driven from an external source and is used to power the internal VCMAIN and VCAON power domains. VCC must always be present when the device is functioning; VCC is also used to power a number of pads that must be always on when the device is functioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

AVCC and AGND are analog supply and ground signals for the AST analog functions. They mainly serve for ADC and USB clock functionality. AVCC is expected to be driven by the same voltage regulator and have similar power availability as VCC. AVCC and AGND have dedicated package balls/pins. In the future, package pins sharing with VCC and GND may be considered based on post-silicon test results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

It is used by AST logic to latch interface signals which may no longer be valid after main_iso_en is active. This signal must be set at least 30ns before main_iso_en is active and must remain active at least 30ns after main_iso_en is no longer active. Note that main_iso_en itself asserts ahead of main_pd_ni. ie, the pwrmgr will set this signal to '1' before requesting the power be turned off. Similar, on power-on, the isolation is only released after power is restored and all powered off modules have been reset.                                                   |

This bit serves as a valid signal for the usb_ref_pulse_i signal. It is set to 1 after the first valid usb_ref_pulse_i event is detected and remains high as long as usb_ref_pulse_i continues to behave as expected (per usb_ref_pulse description). Once usb_ref_pulse deviates from its expected behavior, usb_ref_val_i immediately negates to 0 and remains 0 until after the next valid usb_ref_val pulse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Mainly used for configuration, calibration and trimming. At boot time, data is copied from non-volatile storage into AST registers by the SW boot entity. This interface has no further use beyond this point.

While AST generates most of its clocks on-die, it still needs an external clock for clock calibration and first flash/OTP programming. Clock calibration: AST clock sources are inaccurate by default and must be calibrated prior to use. The results of the calibration are stored in OTP and reloaded by software upon system boot. First Flash / OTP programming: AST clock sources are inaccurate by default and may be out of range for initial flash and OTP programming. In this situation, an external clock may be required for initial programming such that a software image can be loaded to calibrate clocks and advance life cycle. |

It contains observability module selection, signal group selection and enable logic. Open source modules may choose to use this infrastructure for selecting and gating observability signals to be driven into otm_obs_i bus. Whether to actually use this interface or not for open source modules observability is a project decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
