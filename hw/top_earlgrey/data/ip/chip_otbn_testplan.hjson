                Utilizing the existing OTBN smoke test which uses every instruction
                (hw/ip/otbn/dv/smoke/smoke_test.s). Check the final register state matches the
                expected values (in hw/ip/otbn/dv/smoke/smoke_expected.txt). Check OTBN completed
                successfully without errors. This will require a modified version of the smoke test
                which dumps register state to memory.

                Following the smoke test run a new program just to dump out the register state to
                dmem, check the values do not match the previous values from the smoke test run to
                ensure the internal state secure wipe has worked.
