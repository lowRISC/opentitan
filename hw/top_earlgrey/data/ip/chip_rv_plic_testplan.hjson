            The automated SW test enables all interrupts at the PLIC to interrupt the core. It uses
            the `intr_test` CSR in each peripheral to mock assert an interrupt, looping through all
            available interrupts in that peripheral. The ISR verifies that the right interrupt
            occurred. This is used as a catch-all interrupt test for all peripheral integration
            testing within which functionally asserting an interrupt is hard to achieve or not of
            high value.
