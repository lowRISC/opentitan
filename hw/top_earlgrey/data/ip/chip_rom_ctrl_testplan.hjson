            Notes for silicon targets:

            - The only thing that this test can do at the SiVal stage
              is to ensure that the expected and measured digests are
              readable and have the values we expect.

            - That (simpler) check is done in the separate
              chip_sw_rom_ctrl_digests test, so this test doesn't have
              any SiVal stage.
