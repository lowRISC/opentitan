      desc: '''Verify the `reset_info` CSR register for lc or higher resets.

            Generate the 5 types of reset at `lc` level or higher, and check the retention SRAM's
            reset_reason to show that `reset_info` CSR is as expected. This and other rstmgr
            testpoints that require different resets cross-reference the individual IP tests that
            generate those resets, and this testpoint merely adds reset checks in them. Those IP
            blocks are `pwrmgr`, `alert_handler`, `aon_timer`, and `sysrst_ctrl`.

            This should also check the reset's destination IP to make sure some reset side-effect
            is present. Setting some `intr_enable` CSR bit when the test starts and checking it
            after reset seems suitable. The `spi_host` IPs receive multiple resets so they will
            need special consideration.

            SiVal: This testpoint is exercised by a large number of existing reset cases, yet
            it would be best to develop a single test that issues all resets realizable by
            software, not on error injection. The requirement for this testpoint is to check
            the reset info is checked. CPU must be enabled, but no other OTP or lifecycle
            dependencies.
