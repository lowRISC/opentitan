            - Verify that the observe FIFO depth is non-zero via SW - indicating the reception of data over the AST RNG interface.
            - Verify the correctness of the received data with assertion based connectivity checks.

            Notes for silicon targets:
            - This test requires access to the ENTROPY_SRC.FW_OV.EXTRACT_AND_INSERT feature, which is gated by OTP.
              This test might thus need to be done in a secure facility.
            - In silicon, it's not possible to check whether the values match.
              However, checking that the observe FIFO actually fills up is a very fundamental test prior to the validation testing.
