            Check that escalation receivers located inside always-on blocks do not auto-escalate
            due to the reverse ping feature while the system is in deep sleep.

            **Reverse ping timeout calculation**

            The reverse ping timeout calculation is done using the following formula available in
            `prim_esc_receiver`:

            ```
            4  * N_ESC_SEV * (2 * 2 * 2^PING_CNT_DW)
            ```

            `pwrmgr` is the only block consuming the `N_ESC_SEV` and `PING_CNT_DW` compile time
            parameters:

            ```
            alert_handler_reg_pkg::N_ESC_SEV = 4
            alert_handler_reg_pkg::PING_CNT_DW = 16
            ```

            The alert escalation responder inside `pwrmgr` is connected to the `io_div4` clock,
            yielding a target 24MHz frequency. The result expected timeout based on the above
            parameters is thus:

            ```
            reverse_ping_timeout = 0.175s = (4 * 4 ( 2 * 2 * 2^16)) / 24e6
            ```

            **Procedure**

            - On POR reset:
              - Enable all alerts assigning them to ClassA.
              - Enable all local alerts and assign to ClassB.
              - Set escalation configuration to trigger before test wake up time.
              - Set ping timeout to a time less than wake up time.
              - Lock alert configuration and enable ping mechanism.
              - Wait for polling counters to cycle through by busy polling on Ibex for
                `reverse_ping_timeout >> 2` usec.
              - Configure AON to wake up device at a later time, making sure it is greater than the
                `reverse_ping_timeout` calculated in the previous section.
              - Enter deep sleep.
            - On wake up from sleep:
              - Ensure reset status is low power exit. A `kDifRstmgrResetInfoEscalation` signals
                that there was a local escalation and should result in test failure.
              - Disable AON timer.
              - Check there are no flagged local alerts.
