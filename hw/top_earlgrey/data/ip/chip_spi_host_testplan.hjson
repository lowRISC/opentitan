            - Program the SPI host to send a known payload out of the chip on the SPI host ports.
            - The testbench receives the payload and plays it back to the SPI host interface.
            - The SW verifies the sent payload matches the read response and services SPI event
              interrupts.
            - Run with min and max SPI clk frequencies and with single, dual and quad SPI modes.

            Verify all SPI host instances in the chip.

            Notes for silicon targets:
            - The testbench that mimics a physical SPI device should measure the clock to verify that the frequencies for each speed mode is correct.
              This can be done by checking timing of the beginning and the end of the packet.
