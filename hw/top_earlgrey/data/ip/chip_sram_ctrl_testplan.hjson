            - Initialize the entropy_src subsystem to enable OTP_CTRL fetch random data (already
              done by the test_rom startup code).
            - Trigger both SRAMs to fetch a new key and nonce from the OTP_CTRL
            - Drive the CPU to perform random accesses to both RAMs and verify these operations
              complete successfully by using the backdoor interface
            - Fetch a new key from the OTP_CTRL and ensure that the previous contents cannot be
              read anymore.
            - Verify the validity of EDN's output to OTP_CTRL via assertions
              (unique, non-zero data).

            Note: In simulation, this uses a backdoor interface. However, most of the test should be
                  possible on a silicon target (with no EDN assertions, and no backdoor accesses to
                  check operations).

            For the retention SRAM, instruction fetch is completely disabled via design parameter.

            Notes for silicon targets:

            - This test will be reasonably trivial for silicon validation, because the behaviour
              depends on lifecycle state and we're expecting to do these tests on PROD silicon,
              where execution from SRAM is disallowed.
