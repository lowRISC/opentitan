            - On the chip, the Ibex waits to receive the first transaction, then it goes to sleep for 1 second and refuses to pull transactions out of the ACQ FIFO, which should cause clock stretching to happen.
            - Afterwards Ibex repeats the reading transaction and sleeping for 1 second.
            - The Ibex checks that it receives 10 transactions total and that the data in each of the transactions are incremented by one. After that, it sends back a transactions with the data value of the final transaction.
