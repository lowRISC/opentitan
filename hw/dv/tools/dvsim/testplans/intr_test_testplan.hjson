            Verify common intr_test CSRs that allows SW to mock-inject interrupts.
            - Enable a random set of interrupts by writing random value(s) to
              intr_enable CSR(s).
            - Randomly "turn on" interrupts by writing random value(s) to intr_test
              CSR(s).
            - Read all intr_state CSR(s) back to verify that it reflects the same value
              as what was written to the corresponding intr_test CSR.
            - Check the cfg.intr_vif pins to verify that only the interrupts that were
              enabled and turned on are set.
            - Clear a random set of interrupts by writing a randomly value to intr_state
              CSR(s).
            - Repeat the above steps a bunch of times.
