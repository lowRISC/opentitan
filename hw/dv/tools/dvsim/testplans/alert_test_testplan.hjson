            Verify common `alert_test` CSR that allows SW to mock-inject alert requests.
            - Enable a random set of alert requests by writing random value to
              alert_test CSR.
            - Check each `alert_tx.alert_p` pin to verify that only the requested alerts
              are triggered.
            - During alert_handshakes, write `alert_test` CSR again to verify that:
              If `alert_test` writes to current ongoing alert handshake, the `alert_test`
              request will be ignored.
              If `alert_test` writes to current idle alert handshake, a new alert_handshake
              should be triggered.
            - Wait for the alert handshakes to finish and verify `alert_tx.alert_p` pins
              all sets back to 0.
            - Repeat the above steps a bunch of times.
