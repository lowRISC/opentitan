      desc: ''' Verify that entering to an undefined state generates a fatal alert.

            Stimulus:
            - Backdoor force the FSM to any of the undefined values.
            - Randomly force the FSM back to a defined state to ensure the error is latched and
              won't go away until reset.
            - Within the next few cycles, the FSM landing in an invalid state should trigger a
              fatal alert.
            - Repeat for ALL prim_fsm instances in the DUT.

            Checks:
            - Check that fatal alert is triggered.
            - Check that err_code/fault_status is updated correctly and preserved until reset.
            - Verify any operations that follow fail (as applicable).
