title: "Hardware Dashboard"
---

This page serves as the landing spot for all hardware development within the OpenTitan project.

We start off by providing links to the [results of various tool-flows](#results-of-toolflows) run on all of our [Comportable]({{< relref "doc/rm/comportability_specification" >}}) IPs.
This includes DV simulations, FPV and lint, all of which are run with the `dvsim` tool which serves as the common frontend.

The [Comportable IPs](#comportable-ips) following it provides links to their design specifications and DV plans, and tracks their current stage of development.
See the [Hardware Development Stages]({{< relref "/doc/project/development_stages.md" >}}) for description of the hardware stages and how they are determined.

Next, we focus on all available [processor cores](#processor-cores) and provide links to their design specifications, DV plans and the DV simulation results.

Finally, we provide the same set of information for all available [top level designs](#top-level-designs), including an additional dashboard with preliminary synthesis results for some of these designs.
