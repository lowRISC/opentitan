|      VENDOR_TEST      |    no    |     no     |     no      | yes (Digest)  |   yes (CSR)   | Vendor test partition. This is reserved for manufacturing smoke checks. The OTP wrapper control logic inside prim_otp is allowed to read/write to this region. ECC uncorrectable errors seen on the functional prim_otp interface will not lead to an alert for this partition. Instead, such errors will be reported as correctable ECC errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This contains data that changes software behavior in the ROM, for example enabling defensive features in ROM or selecting failure modes if verification fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| OWNERSHIP_SLOT_STATE  |    no    |     no     |     yes     |      no       |   yes (CSR)   | SW managed asset ownership states partition.  Multibit enable value for the tracking the asset ownership states. Note that the states can be written multiple times in a device lifetime. The values to be written are engineered in the same way as the LC_CTRL state encoding words so that the ECC encoding remains valid even after updating the values.  The constants can be found in the lc_ctrl_state_pkg.sv package.  The programming order has to adhere to:  OWNERSHIP_ST_RAW (factory all-zero state) -> OWNERSHIP_ST_LOCKED0 -> OWNERSHIP_ST_RELEASED0 -> ... OWNERSHIP_ST_SCRAPPED  Note that if there are less than 4 slots available the higher slot states become logically equivalent to OWNERSHIP_SCRAPPED (firmware has to handle this correctly). |

This contains EN_SRAM_IFETCH: Enable / disable execute from SRAM CSR switch. SOC_DBG_STATE: Multibit enable value for the SOC debug authorization.

This partition cannot be locked since the life cycle state needs to advance to RMA in-field. Note that while this partition is not marked secret, it is not readable nor writeable via the DAI. Only the LC controller can access this partition, and even via the LC controller it is not possible to read the raw manufacturing life cycle state in encoded form, since that encoding is considered a netlist secret. The LC controller only exposes a decoded version of this state.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
