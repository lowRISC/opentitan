# Top Darjeeling

## Specification

The datasheet and specification of Darjeeling is located [here](./doc/datasheet.md).

## Memory Map

The base addresses of the memory and peripherals are defined in this [table](./doc/memory_map.md).

The choice of memory, or lack thereof at location 0x0 confers two exclusive benefits:
- If there are no memories at location 0x0, then null pointers will immediately error and be noticed by software (the xbar will fail to decode and route)
- If SRAM is placed at 0, accesses to data located within 2KB of 0x0 can be accomplished with a single instruction and thus reduce code size.

For the purpose of `top_darjeeling`, the first option has been chosen to benefit software development and testing.

## Tooling to generate RTL, DV, and SW code

Large parts of Darjeeling's code is generated by [topgen](../../util/topgen/README.md) and [ipgen](../../util/ipgen/README.md) based on configuration and template files.
Please do not edit autogenerated code files directly.
Please see the documentation of topgen and ipgen as well as the [usage examples for Earlgrey](../top_earlgrey/README.md#tool-topgen) for how to work with the tooling as well as configuration and template files.
