# Top Darjeeling

## Specification

The datasheet and specification of Darjeeling is located [here](./doc/datasheet.md).

## Tooling to generate RTL, DV, and SW code

Large parts of Darjeeling's code is generated by [topgen](../../util/topgen/README.md) and [ipgen](../../util/ipgen/README.md) based on configuration and template files.
Please do not edit autogenerated code files directly.
Please see the documentation of topgen and ipgen as well as the [usage examples for Earlgrey](../top_earlgrey/README.md#tool-topgen) for how to work with the tooling as well as configuration and template files.
