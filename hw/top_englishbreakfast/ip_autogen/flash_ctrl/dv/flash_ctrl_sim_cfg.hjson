// We want to use a different tool in another flash_ctrl env, but overriding `tool` doesn't work, as
// it needs to first import all the included hjson to know what to override, but some sim_cfg hjson
// files depends on the `tool` variable, such as {tool}.hjson.
// To solve this issue, split out the sim_cfg file into 2 files. the base contains everything except
// `tool`, the other one includes the base and set the `tool`.
//
// In this file, only `tool` can be set. Tests or other configuration should be add in
// flash_ctrl_base_sim_cfg.hjson.
