# If a PR changes a file that matches a pattern in this file it will be blocked
# from merged by CI. The patterns as glob-like patterns matched using python
# fnmatch. In particular note there is no special handling for '/' so '*' can
# match multiple directory levels e.g. 'this/is/*/a/path' matches both
# 'this/is/a/foo/path' and 'this/is/a/foo/bar/path'.
#
# Anyone on the COMMITTERS list can authorize a change by adding a comment
# with:
#
# CHANGE AUTHORIZED: path/to/file
#
# To the PR. If there are multiple changes to authorize, one authorization
# is required per file and there is one authorization per line in the
# comment.
#
# At least two committers must authorize the change to pass.

# Ensure changes to block system must be authorized
