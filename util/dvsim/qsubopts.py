       -binding [ binding_instance ] binding_strategy

              A  job  can  request a specific processor core binding (processor affinity)
              with this parameter. This request is neither a hard nor a soft request,
              it is a hint for the execution host to do this if possible.  Please note that
              the  requested binding strategy is not used for resource  selection  within
              Grid Engine.  As a result an execution host might be selected where Grid Engine
              does not even know the hardware topology and therefore is not able
              to apply the requested binding.

              To enforce Grid Engine to select hardware on which the binding can be applied
              please use the -l switch in combination with the complex attribute m_topology.

              binding_instance is an optional parameter.
              It might either be env, pe or set depending on which instance  should
              accomplish the job to core binding. If the value for binding_instance
              is not specified then set will be used.

              env  means  that  the  environment variable SGE_BINDING will be exported
              to the job environment of the job. This variable contains the selected
              operating system internal processor numbers.  They might be  more  than  selected
              cores  in  presence of SMT or CMT because each core could be represented
              by multiple processor identifiers.  The processor numbers are space separated.

              pe means that the information about the selected cores appears in
              the fourth column of the pe_hostfile. Here the logical  core  and
              socket numbers are printed (they start at 0 and have no holes)
              in colon separated pairs (i.e. 0,0:1,0 which means core 0 on socket 0 and
              core 0 on socket 1).  For more  information  about  the  $pe_hostfile
              check ge_pe(5)

              set (default if nothing else is specified). The binding strategy is applied
              by Grid Engine. How this is achieved depends on the underlying hardware
              architecture of the execution host where the submitted job will be started.

              On Solaris 10 hosts a processor set will be created where the job can
              exclusively run in.  Because of  operating system limitations at least
              one core must remain unbound. This resource could of course used by an unbound job.

              On  Linux  hosts  a  processor affinity mask will be set to restrict  the job
              to run exclusively on the selected cores.
              The operating system allows other unbound processes to use these cores.
              Please note that on  Linux  the binding  requires  a  Linux  kernel
              version of 2.6.16 or greater. It might be even possible to use a kernel with
              lower version number but in that case additional kernel patches have to be
              applied. The loadcheck  tool  in  the utilbin directory can be used to check
              if the hosts capabilities.  You can also use the -sep in combination with
              -cb of qconf(5) command to identify if Grid Engine is able to recognize the
              hardware topology.

              Possible values for binding_strategy are as follows:

                  linear:<amount>[:<socket>,<core>]
                  striding:<amount>:<n>[:<socket>,<core>]
                  explicit:[<socket>,<core>;...]<socket>,<core>

              For the binding strategy linear and striding there is an optional
              socket and core pair attached.
              These  denotes the mandatory starting point for the first core to bind on.

              linear  means  that  Grid Engine tries to bind the job on amount successive cores.
              If socket and core is omitted then Grid Engine first allocates successive cores
              on the first empty socket found.  Empty means that  there  are
              no  jobs bound to the socket by Grid Engine.  If this is not  possible or is
              not sufficient Grid Engine tries to
              find (further) cores on the socket with the most unbound cores and so on.
              If the amount of allocated  cores  is
              lower  than  requested  cores,  no binding is done for the job.
              If socket and core is specified then Grid Engine
              tries to find amount of empty cores beginning with this starting point.
              If this is not possible then binding  is not done.

              striding means that Grid Engine tries to find cores with a certain offset.
              It will select amount of empty cores with a offset of n -1 cores in between.
              Start point for the search algorithm is socket 0  core  0.  As  soon  as
              amount  cores are found they will be used to do the job binding.
              If there are not enough empty cores or if correct offset cannot be
              achieved then there will be no binding done.

              explicit binds the specified sockets and cores that  are  mentioned
              in  the  provided  socket/core  list.  Each socket/core  pair  has to
              be specified only once.If a socket/core pair is already in use by a different job the
              whole binding request will be ignored.

              Qalter allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only  be  in  effect
              after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in qmon is specified then these values
              will be passe to defined JSV instances as parameters with the names binding_strategy,
              binding_type, binding_amount,  binding_step,  binding_socket,
              binding_core, binding_exp_n, binding_exp_socket<id>, binding_exp_core<id>.

              Please  note that the length of the socket/core value list of the explicit binding is
              reported as binding_exp_n.
              <id> will be replaced by the position of the socket/core pair  within  the  explicit
              list  (0  <=  id  <  binding_exp_n).   The first socket/core pair of the explicit
              binding will be reported with the parameter names bind-
              ing_exp_socket0 and binding_exp_core0.

              Values that do not apply for the specified binding will not be reported to JSV.
              E.g. binding_step will only  be
              reported for the striding binding and all binding_exp_* values will passed to
              JSV if explicit binding was speci‐
              fied.  (see -jsv  option  below or find more information concerning

              It will be transferred to the execution host. qsub/qrsh will search

              For qsh, qrsh and qlogin only the
              standard error stream of prolog and epilog is redirected.  If the path
              constitutes an absolute  path  name,  the
              error-path  attribute  of  the  job  is  set to path, including the hostname.
              If the path name is relative, Grid
              Engine expands path either with the current working directory path
              (if the -cwd switch (see above) is also spec‐
              ified)  or with the home directory path. If hostname is present,
              the standard error stream will be placed in the
              corresponding location only if the job runs on the specified host.
              If the path contains a ":"  without  a  host‐
              name, a leading ":" has to be specified.

              By  default  the  file name for interactive jobs is /dev/null.
              For batch jobs the default file name has the form
              job_name.ejob_id and job_name.ejob_id.task_id for array job tasks (see -t option
              below).

              If path is a directory, the standard error stream of the job will be put
              in this  directory  under  the  default
              file  name.  If the pathname contains certain pseudo environment variables,
              their value will be expanded at run‐
              time of the job and will be used to constitute the standard error stream path name.
              The following  pseudo  envi‐
              ronment variables are supported currently:

              $HOME       home directory on execution machine
              $USER       user ID of job owner
              $JOB_ID     current job ID
              $JOB_NAME   current job name (see -N option)
              $HOSTNAME   name of the execution host
              $TASK_ID    array job task index number

              Alternatively  to  $HOME  the tilde sign "~" can be used as common in csh(1)
              or ksh(1).  Note, that the "~" sign
              also works in combination with user names, so that "~<user>" expands to the
              home  directory  of  <user>.  Using
              another user ID than that of the job owner requires corresponding permissions,
              of course.

              Qalter  allows  changing  this option even while the job executes.

              Defines or redefines the file used for the standard input stream of
              the job. If the file constitutes an absolute
              filename, the input-path attribute of the job is set to path,
              including the hostname. If the path name is  rela‐
              tive, Grid Engine expands path either with the current working
              directory path (if the -cwd switch (see above) is
              also specified) or with the home directory path. If hostname is present,
              the  standard  input  stream  will  be
              placed  in  the  corresponding  location  only if the job runs
              on the specified host. If the path contains a ":"
              without a hostname, a leading ":" has to be specified.

              By default /dev/null is the input stream for the job.

              It is possible to use certain pseudo variables, whose values
              will be expanded at runtime of the job and will  be
              used to express the standard input stream as described in
              the -e option for the standard error stream.

              Qalter  allows  changing  this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect

              qrsh allows the user to start a task in an already scheduled parallel job.
              The option -inherit  tells  qrsh  to
              read a job id from the environment variable JOB_ID and start the
              specified command as a task in this job. Please
              note that in this case, the hostname of the host where the command
              will be executed must precede the command  to
              execute; the syntax changes to

              qrsh -inherit [ other options ] hostname command [ command_args ]

              Note also, that in combination with -inherit, most other command line
              options will be ignored.  Only the options
              -verbose, -v and -V will be interpreted.  As a replacement to option
              -cwd please use -v PWD.

              Usually a task should have the same environment (including the
              current working directory) as  the  corresponding
              job, so specifying the option -V should be suitable for most applications.

              Note:  If  in  your  system  the qmaster tcp port is not configured as a service,
              but rather via the environment
              variable GE_QMASTER_PORT, make sure that this variable is set in the
              environment when calling qrsh or qmake with

              Defines  or  redefines the job share of the job relative to other jobs.
              Job share is an unsigned integer value.
              The default job share value for jobs is 0.

              The job share influences the Share Tree Policy and the Functional Policy.
              It has no effect on  the  Urgency  and
              Override  Policies  (see  share_tree(5), sched_conf(5) and the
              Grid Engine Installation and Administration Guide
              for further information on the resource management policies supported
              by Grid Engine).

              In case of the Share Tree Policy, users can distribute the tickets to
              which they are  currently  entitled  among
              their  jobs  using different shares assigned via -js.
              If all jobs have the same job share value, the tickets are
              distributed evenly. Otherwise, jobs receive tickets relative
              to the different job shares. Job shares are treated
              like an additional level in the share tree in the latter case.

              In  connection  with  the  Functional Policy, the job share can be
              used to weight jobs within the functional job
              category.  Tickets are distributed relative to any uneven
              job share distribution treated as a virtual share dis‐
              tribution level underneath the functional job category.

              If  both  the  Share Tree and the Functional Policy are active,
              the job shares will have an effect in both poli‐
              cies, and the tickets independently derived in each of them are
              added to the total number of  tickets  for  each

              Submits a so called Array Job, i.e. an array of identical
              tasks being differentiated only by an index number and
              being treated by Grid Engine almost like a series of jobs.
              The option argument to -t  specifies  the  number  of
              array job tasks and the index number which will be associated with the tasks.
              The index numbers will be exported
              to the job tasks via the environment variable GE_TASK_ID.
              The option arguments n, m  and  s  will  be  available
              through the environment variables GE_TASK_FIRST,
              GE_TASK_LAST and  GE_TASK_STEPSIZE.

              Following restrictions apply to the values n and m:

                     1 <= n <= MIN(2^31-1, max_aj_tasks)
                     1 <= m <= MIN(2^31-1, max_aj_tasks)
                     n <= m

              max_aj_tasks is defined in the cluster configuration (see sge_conf(5))

              The  task  id range specified in the option argument may be a single
              number, a simple range of the form n-m or a
              range with a step size. Hence, the task id range specified by
              2-10:2 would result in the task id indexes  2,  4,
              6,  8, and 10, for a total of 5 identical tasks, each with
              the environment variable GE_TASK_ID containing one of
              the 5 index numbers.

              All array job tasks inherit the same resource requests and
              attribute definitions as specified  in  the  qsub  or
              qalter  command  line,  except  for  the  -t  option.
              The tasks are scheduled independently and, provided enough
              resources exist, concurrently, very much like separate jobs.
              However, an array job or a sub-array there of  can
              be  accessed  as a single unit by commands like qmod(1) or qdel(1).
              See the corresponding manual pages for fur‐
              ther detail.

              Array jobs are commonly used to execute the same type of operation
              on varying input data  sets  correlated  with
              the task index number. The number of tasks in a array job is unlimited.

              STDOUT and STDERR of array job tasks will be written into different
              files with the default location

              <jobname>.['e'|'o']<job_id>'.'<task_id>

              In order to change this default, the -e and -o options (see above)
              can be used together with the pseudo environ‐
              ment variables $HOME, $USER, $JOB_ID, $JOB_NAME, $HOSTNAME, and $GE_TASK_ID.

              Note, that you can use the output redirection to divert the output
              of all tasks into  the  same  file,  but  the
              result of this is undefined.
