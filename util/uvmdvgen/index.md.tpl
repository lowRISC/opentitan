title: "${name.upper()} DV document"

<!-- Copy this file to hw/ip/${name}/doc/dv/index.md and make changes as needed.
For convenience '${name}' in the document can be searched and replaced easily with the
desired IP (with case sensitivity!). Also, use the testbench block diagram
located at OpenTitan team drive / 'design verification'
as a starting point and modify it to reflect your ${name} testbench and save it
to hw/ip/${name}/doc/dv/tb.svg. It should get linked and rendered under the block
diagram section below. Please update / modify / remove sections below as
applicable. Once done, remove this comment before making a PR. -->

${'##'} Goals
* **DV**
  * Verify all ${name.upper()} IP features by running dynamic simulations with a SV/UVM based testbench
  * Develop and run all tests based on the [testplan](#testplan) below towards closing code and functional coverage on the IP and all of its sub-modules
* **FPV**
  * Verify TileLink device protocol compliance with an SVA based testbench

${'##'} Current status
* [Design & verification stage]({{< relref "hw" >}})
  * [HW development stages]({{< relref "doc/project/development_stages" >}})
* [Simulation results](https://reports.opentitan.org/hw/ip/${name}/dv/latest/results.html)

${'##'} Design features
For detailed information on ${name.upper()} design features, please see the [${name.upper()} HWIP technical specification]({{< relref "hw/ip/${name}/doc" >}}).

${'##'} Testbench architecture
${name.upper()} testbench has been constructed based on the [CIP testbench architecture]({{< relref "hw/dv/sv/cip_lib/doc" >}}).

${'###'} Block diagram
![Block diagram](tb.svg)

${'###'} Top level testbench
The top level testbench is located at `hw/ip/${name}/dv/tb.sv`.
It instantiates the ${name.upper()} DUT module `hw/ip/${name}/rtl/${name}.sv`.
In addition, it instantiates the following interfaces, connects them to the DUT and sets their handle into `uvm_config_db`:
* [Clock and reset interface]({{< relref "hw/dv/sv/common_ifs" >}})
* [TileLink host interface]({{< relref "hw/dv/sv/tl_agent/README.md" >}})
* ${name.upper()} IOs
* Interrupts ([`pins_if`]({{< relref "hw/dv/sv/common_ifs" >}}))
* Alerts ([`alert_esc_if`]({{< relref "hw/dv/sv/alert_esc_agent/README.md" >}}))
* Devmode ([`pins_if`]({{< relref "hw/dv/sv/common_ifs" >}}))

${'###'} Common DV utility components
The following utilities provide generic helper tasks and functions to perform activities that are common across the project:
* [dv_utils_pkg]({{< relref "hw/dv/sv/dv_utils/README.md" >}})
* [csr_utils_pkg]({{< relref "hw/dv/sv/csr_utils/README.md" >}})

${'###'} Compile-time configurations
[list compile time configurations, if any and what are they used for]

${'###'} Global types & methods
All common types and methods defined at the package level can be found in
`${name}_env_pkg`. Some of them in use are:
```systemverilog
[list a few parameters, types & methods; no need to mention all]
```
% if is_cip:
${'###'} TL_agent
The ${name.upper()} testbench instantiates (already handled in CIP base env) [tl_agent]({{< relref "hw/dv/sv/tl_agent/README.md" >}}).
This provides the ability to drive and independently monitor random traffic via the TL host interface into the ${name.upper()} device.

% endif
% if has_alerts:
${'###'} Alert_agents
${name.upper()} testbench instantiates (already handled in CIP base env) [alert_agents]({{< relref "hw/dv/sv/alert_esc_agent/README.md" >}}):
[list alert names].
The alert_agents provide the ability to drive and independently monitor alert handshakes via alert interfaces in ${name.upper()} device.

% if has_ral:
${'###'} UVM RAL Model
The ${name.upper()} RAL model is created with the [`ralgen`]({{< relref "hw/dv/tools/ralgen/README.md" >}}) FuseSoC generator script automatically when the simulation is at the build stage.

It can be created manually by invoking [`regtool`]({{< relref "util/reggen/README.md" >}}):

${'###'} Reference models
[Describe reference models in use if applicable, example: SHA256/HMAC]

${'###'} Stimulus strategy
${'####'} Test sequences
The test sequences reside in `hw/ip/${name}/dv/env/seq_lib`.
All test sequences are extended from `${name}_base_vseq`, which is extended from `cip_base_vseq` and serves as a starting point.
It provides commonly used handles, variables, functions and tasks that the test sequences can simple use / call.
Some of the most commonly used tasks / functions are as follows:
* task 1:
* task 2:

${'####'} Functional coverage
To ensure high quality constrained random stimulus, it is necessary to develop a functional coverage model.
The following covergroups have been developed to prove that the test intent has been adequately met:
* cg1:
* cg2:

${'###'} Self-checking strategy
${'####'} Scoreboard
The `${name}_scoreboard` is primarily used for end to end checking.
It creates the following analysis ports to retrieve the data monitored by corresponding interface agents:
* analysis port1:
* analysis port2:
<!-- explain inputs monitored, flow of data and outputs checked -->

${'####'} Assertions
* TLUL assertions: The `tb/${name}_bind.sv` file binds the `tlul_assert` [assertions]({{< relref "hw/ip/tlul/doc/TlulProtocolChecker.md" >}}) to the IP to ensure TileLink interface protocol compliance.
* Unknown checks on DUT outputs: The RTL has assertions to ensure all outputs are initialized to known values after coming out of reset.
* assert prop 1:
* assert prop 2:

${'##'} Building and running tests
We are using our in-house developed [regression tool]({{< relref "hw/dv/tools/README.md" >}}) for building and running our tests and regressions.
Please take a look at the link for detailed information on the usage, capabilities, features and known issues.
Here's how to run a smoke test:
```console
$ $REPO_TOP/util/dvsim/dvsim.py $REPO_TOP/hw/ip/${name}/dv/${name}_sim_cfg.hjson -i ${name}_smoke
```

${'##'} Testplan
<!-- TODO: Add the testplan to `/util/build_docs.py`. -->
