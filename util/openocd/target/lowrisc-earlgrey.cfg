# Always use hardware breakpoints. Since we don't use `flash bank` commands,
# OpenOCD won't provide a memory map to GDB. This means that GDB isn't be aware
# that the code resides in a read-only memory, and therefore should use hardware
# breakpoints. This setting makes OpenOCD convert the software breakpoints into
# hardware ones.
