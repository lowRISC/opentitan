title: "OpenTitan Software Build Instructions"
---

All OpenTitan software is built with [Bazel](https://bazel.build/).

For example, to build and run the OpenTitan UART smoke test located in `sw/device/tests/` for Verilator, run

```console
cd "$REPO_TOP"
bazel test --test_output=streamed //sw/device/tests:uart_smoketest_sim_verilator
```

The resulting binaries will be located under `bazel-out/`. For more information, check out [the Building Software guide]({{< relref "doc/getting_started/build_sw" >}}).
