== Introduction
=== About

This document describes the RISC-V Compliance Testing framework which is used to test a RISC-V device's compliance  to the different RISC-V specifications.

* It explains the required structure of a test, the framework around the tests, the running of individual tests, and the suites of tests.

* It includes, as reference, details of the first suite of tests for the RV32I and their reference signatures.

* It explains how to set up different targets to run the tests.

* It is an expansion of the work carried out by Codasip in the second half of 2017.

This document is made freely available under a <<app_cc_by_4.0>>.

=== Purpose of compliance tests

The goal of compliance tests is to check whether the processor under development meets the open RISC-V standards or not. It is considered as non-functional testing meaning that it doesn’t substitute for design verification. This can be interpreted as testing to check all important aspects of the specification but without focusing on details, for example, on all possible values of instruction operands or all combinations of possible registers.

The result that compliance tests provide to the user is an assurance that the specification has been interpreted correctly and the design under test (DUT) can be declared as RISC-V compliant.

=== Intended audience

This document is intended for design and verification engineers who wish to develop new compliance tests and also those who wish check if their implementation (simulation models, HDL models, etc.) of a RISC-V processor is compliant to the RISC-V specifications.

=== Future work

This is a work in progress. A number of areas need resolving before the work is complete, and are recorded here so they do not get forgotten.

Consider whether `compliance_test.h` is needed :: It's not clear if this belongs in target directories, or if it is needed at all.

Generalize Makefile configuration :: At present each platform requires editing of the makefile, and many areas are not even fully parameterized.  Again we wish to explore a wider range of platforms before deciding what needs parameterization.  For now `COMPILE_TARGET` allows a choice between GCC and LLVM.  More generally, we know that with tools like _autotools_ and _cmake_ this is a well understood problem to solve.

Free up all registers for compliance testing :: At present some platforms have macros which use some registers in set up and verification, thus excluding them from compliance testing. We believe careful structuring of the macros will mean this problem can be avoided in the future, thus avoiding any registers being excluded from compliance testing.

|================================================================================

== Overall structure
=== The compliance test

At the heart of the testing infrastructure is the detailed compliance test.  This is the RISC-V assembler code that is executed on the processor and that provides results in a defined memory area (the _signature_).  The test should only use the minimum of instructions and only those absolutely necessary.  It should only use instructions and registers from the ISA instruction set on which it is targeted.

=== The Test Virtual Machine

The test runs in the context of a _Test Virtual Machine_ (TVM) as defined and available at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests. There will be a different TVM for each instruction subset and each profile.

=== The target environment

A specific target will need to be chosen and setup to run the Test. This can be an Instruction Set Simulator (ISS), full system simulator (emulator), HDL simulator, FPGA prototype, or a board/chip, etc.  The test runs in the context of a TVM and is set up to run on the specific target.  The _target environment_ controls the loading of the test plus TVM onto the target, configures the device if needed, controls the execution, and then extracts the signature.

=== The processor configuration (device configuration)

The RISC-V specification allows many optional instructions, registers, and other features.  Many targets have a fixed selection of these optional items which cannot be changed. For example, a chip is fixed in the mask.  A simulator on the other hand may implement all known options and will need to be constrained to have only the required options available.  There will need to be processor configuration for those target devices which need to be constrained to only reflect the features of the device being compliance tested. This is essential when writing compliance tests to ensure that only available options are used in the tests.

=== The test signature

The _test signature_ is defined as reference data written into memory during the execution of the test.  It should record values and results of the operation of the Test. It is expected that an implementation, at the end of a test, dumps the signature in to a file such that only 4-bytes are written per line, starting with the most-significant byte on the left.

=== The test reference signature

The _test reference signature_ is the _test signature_ saved from an execution run of the RISC‑V _golden model_.  This is currently from a RISC-V ISS, but the intention is that the RISC-V Formal Model from the RISCV.org Formal Working Group will be used when it is complete, functional, and available. 

=== The test suites

Tests are grouped into different functional test suites targeting the different subsets of the full RISC-V specifications.  There will be ISA and privilege suites.

For information on the status of the different test suites, look here: link:../riscv-test-suite/README.md[../riscv-test-suite/README.md]


=== The test framework

This works at several levels.  At the lowest level it runs a test with a TVM on a specific configured target device and compares the test’s output test signature against the test reference signature and reports if there is any difference. A difference indicates that the target has failed that specific compliance test.

The test framework allows different test suites to be run depending on the capabilities of the target

The test framework collates the results of all the Tests that comprise a Test Suite and reports the overall results.

== Developing new tests
=== Structure

* Clone directory structure of an existing test suite alongside the RV32I tree.

* This must include test and reference signature directories (`src` and `references`).

* Check the target environment setup files.

* Check the processor configuration files.

=== Process

This description assumes the use of a configurable simulator with good trace and debug capabilities.

* Work on one test at a time.

* Ensure that the processor configuration is set appropriately.

* Use the `RVTEST` macros (defined in `compliance_io.h`) to make it easy to see the details of a Test’s execution. There are macros for assertions (`RVTEST_IO_ASSERT_GPR_EQ`) and tracing (`RVTEST_IO_WRITE_STR`) which are empty on targets that can not implement them.

* Assuming you are developing the test on a simulator, use the simulator’s tracing capabilities, especially a register change mode to single step your test examining all changing registers etc. to ensure your test is stimulating what is intending.

* Make sure that the signature you generate at the end of the run shows adequate internal test state such that any checks do report as fails if wrong.

* When you are satisfied that the test does what is intended and that the test signature is correct, copy this into a test reference signature (in the references directory).

For a test suite to be complete it needs to have tests that exercise the full functionality of what it is intended to test. There are tools available to measure instruction and other resource coverage. These should be used to ensure that 100% of the intended instructions have been tested.

== Test framework

For running compliance tests, the Test Virtual Machine (TVM) “p” available at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests is utilized.

In addition to using the basic functionality of the TVM, the script for running compliance tests runs the test on the target and then performs comparison of the target’s generated test signature to the manually reviewed test reference signature.

See the chapter below for selecting and setting up the target (simulator, or hardware, etc.).

If using a target that requires the processor to be configured, see the chapter below on processor configuration.

You will also need to have a suitable compiler tool chain (GCC or LLVM) installed in your environment and available on your path.

Tests are run by commands in the top level `Makefile` which has targets for simulate and verify

[source,make]
----
RISCV_TARGET ?= riscvOVPsim
RISCV_DEVICE ?= rv32i
RISCV_PREFIX ?= riscv64-unknown-elf-

simulate:
        make RISCV_TARGET=$(RISCV_TARGET) \
             RISCV_DEVICE=$(RISCV_DEVICE) \
             RISCV_PREFIX=$(RISCV_PREFIX) \
             run -C $(SUITEDIR)

verify:
    riscv-test-env/verify.sh
----

== Setting the target environment

The target environment needs setting up to allow the compliance tests to be run on the target.  This can be used while developing compliance test suites or it can be used with new targets to see if they correctly execute the compliance test suites and are compliant!

This chapter provides information on the currently available targets and includes a short tutorial on how to add a new target.

=== Imperas riscvOVPsim compliance simulator

For tracing the test the following  macros are defined in `riscv-target/riscvOVPsim/compliance_io.h`:

[source,make]
----
RVTEST_IO_INIT
RVTEST_IO_WRITE_STR(_SP, _STR)
RVTEST_IO_ASSERT_GPR_EQ(_SP, _R, _I)
----

An example of a test that uses the tracing macros is `riscv-test-suite/rv32i/ISA/src/I-IO.S`.

To configure the simulator for different target devices there needs to be a Makefile fragment in the `device` directory.

The Makefile fragment for RV32I is in `riscv-target/riscvOVPsim/device/rv32i`

In the top level Makefile there needs to be a selection for the target and device:
[source,make]
----
RISCV_TARGET?=riscvOVPsim
RISCV_DEVICE?=rv32i
----

The path to the RUN_TARGET is defined within the riscv-target Makefile.include.


=== Codasip ISA simulator

=== GNU CGEN ISS
==== Within GDB

tbd

==== Via GDB Remote Serial Protocol

tbd

=== Berkeley Spike ISA simulator
For spike the file `riscv-target/spike/compliance_io.h` has the trace macros defined as empty.  The Makefile fragment in `riscv-target/spike/device/rv32i` has the spike run command for the RV32I device.

=== Berkeley Rocket Chip emulators
Additional environment variables:

* `ROCKET_DIR`: Specifies link:https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip[Rocket Chip] directory. Required.
* `ROCKET_CONFIG`: Specifies Rocket Chip link:https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip/blob/master/src/main/scala/system/Configs.scala[configuration]. **Usually** defaults to `DefaultConfig` or `DefaultRV32Config`, unless the aforementioned configurations do not support a test suite's ISA extensions (for example, in the case of `rv32ud`).

Before running the compliance test, make sure that the correct emulator is built, following the link:https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip#emulator[instructions in the Rocket Chip repository].

**Note**: Rocket Chip's `DefaultRV32Config` is currently failing the following test — link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-compliance/issues/31[rv32i/I-MISALIGN_JMP-01.S].

=== SiFive RISC-V ISA Formal Specification
Additional environment variables:

* `FORMALSPEC_DIR`: Specifies link:https://github.com/sifive/RiscvSpecFormal[formal specification] directory. Required.

Build the link:https://github.com/sifive/RiscvSpecFormal[formal model] before running compliance tests. The model currently supports `RV32i` with `a`, `c`, and `f` extensions.

**Note**: Some tests in the `rv32i` suite will fail because privileged CSRs are not yet implemented in the formal specification.

=== GRIFT (Galois RISC-V Formal Tools) Simulator

To run the compliance test suite on the GRIFT simulator, first build/install GRIFT (https://github.com/GaloisInc/grift). The GRIFT simulation tool `grift-sim` needs to be on your PATH.

Then, we can run the compliance suite via:

[source,make]
----
make RISCV_TARGET=grift
----

We have ported the rv32i, rv32im, rv32imc, rv64i, and rv64im tests. You can also run these individually, e.g.:

[source,make]
----
make RISCV_TARGET=grift RISCV_ISA=rv64i RISCV_DEVICE=rv64i

=== Adding a new Target

In this section, a short tutorial how to add a user target in the TVM is provided.

If you do not want to use the TVM at all, it is recommended to just take the tests and references and incorporate them into your testing environment.  The only requirement needed in this case is that there must be an option to dump the results from the target in the test environment so as the comparison to test reference signature is possible.

The following steps demonstrate an example in which a target was replaced by Codasip ISA simulator. In a similar way, any RISC-V ISA simulator or any RTL simulation model of the RISC-V processor can be connected.

* Redefine macros in `ISA/src/compliance_test.h` and `binary_coding/src/compliance_test.h`.
+
For example, to support Codasip ISA simulator as Target, it was necessary to redefine `RV_COMPLIANCE_HALT macro`, `RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_BEGIN` macro and `RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_END` macro in `ISA/compliance_test.h` in the following way:
+
[source,c]
----
#define RV_COMPLIANCE_HALT
        add     x31, x0, 1
        sw      x31, codasip_syscall, t0
----

* This means that on the address defined by `codasip_syscall`, the 1 value is stored and this is interpreted as `HALT` for the Codasip ISA simulator.
+
[source,c]
----
#define RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_BEGIN
        .align  4;
        .global codasip_signature_start;
codasip_signature_start:
----
+
[source,c]
----
#define RV_COMPLIANCE_DATA_END
        .align  4;
        .global codasip_signature_end;
codasip_signature_end:
----

* The Codasip ISA simulator dumps data from the addresses bounded by labels `codasip_signature_start` and `codasip_signature_end` to `stdout`.  The dumped data represent the results of the tests.

* Modify Makefiles in `ISA/Makefile` and `binary_coding/Makefile`.  It is important to change tools that are evaluated and parameters that are passed to the tools.
+
For example, to support the Codasip ISA simulator as the device under test
(DUT), it was necessary to change `RISCV_SIM` from `spike` to
`codix_berkelium-ia-isimulator –r` and parameters for running the simulator
from `+signature=$(work_dir)/$<.signature.output` to `–info 5` plus handle
redirection to a file by `1>$(work_dir)/$<.signature.output`.

== Configuring the target device

This section is for how to specify which optional parts are being used

NOTE: This is primarily for simulators.

In the directory `riscv-target/*/device` there are directories that have Makefile fragments that configure the simulator to simulate only those parts of the RISC-V specification that is required for the specific target device being tested.

For example for the riscvOVPsim to be configured to be a RV32I
[source,make]
----
RUN_TARGET= \
        riscvOVPsim.exe --variant RV32I --program $(work_dir_isa)/$< \
            --signaturedump \
            --override riscvOVPsim/cpu/sigdump/SignatureFile=$(work_dir_isa)/$(*).signature.output \
            --override riscvOVPsim/cpu/sigdump/ResultReg=3 \
            --override riscvOVPsim/cpu/simulateexceptions=T \
            --logfile $(work_dir_isa)/$@
----
[appendix]
== One ISA Test

For a detailed description of one ISA test please have a look at the example: link:../riscv-test-suite/rv32i/src/I-IO.S[`I-IO.S`].

This includes use of all the logging and assertion macros and shows how a test is split into sections.

[appendix]
== Repository structure

The top level directory contains a `README.md` file giving an overview of the project, top level `Makefile`, `ChangeLog`, the `verify.sh` script and complete license files for the Creative Commons and BSD licenses used by the task group.  There are then four top level directories.

`doc`:: All the documentation for the project, written using _AsciiDoc_.

`riscv-target`:: Contains a further subdirectory for each target, within which are placed the `compliance_io.h` header for that target and a `device` directory for all the devices of that target. If the `$TARGETDIR` environment variable is set to another directory, the scripts will search this directory for targets instead.

`riscv-test-env`:: This contains headers common to all environments, and then a directory for each TVM variant, with `link.ld` linker script and `riscv_test.h` header.

`riscv-test-suite`:: This contains a subdirectory for each instruction set or instruction set extension.  Within each subdirectory the source code and reference output for each test are in the `ISA` directory.

`riscv-ovpsim`:: This contains a copy of the Imperas OVP riscvOVPsim simulator for use in compliance testing. It includes a subdirectory of examples with pre-compiled .elf files and has binaries of the simulator for Linux64 and Windows64. This is referenced by the makefiles for developing and running the compliance suites. riscvOVPsim can run all the tracing and assertion macros used in the tests.

==== Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

==== Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. *Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.*

b. *To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.*

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

==== Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
