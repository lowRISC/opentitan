 * Manifest for boot stage images stored in flash.
 *
 * OpenTitan secure boot, at a minimum, consists of three boot stages: ROM,
 * ROM_EXT, and the first owner boot stage, e.g. BL0. ROM is stored in the
 * read-only ROM while remaining stages are stored in flash. This structure
 * must be placed at the start of ROM_EXT and first owner boot stage images so
 * that ROM and ROM_EXT can verify the integrity and authenticity of the next
 * stage and configure peripherals as needed before handing over execution.
 *
 * Use of this struct for stages following the first owner boot stage is
 * optional.
 *
 * Note: The definitions in
 * sw/host/rom_ext_image_tools/signer/image/src/manifest.rs must be updated if
 * this struct is modified. Please see the instructions in that file.

   * Image signature.

   * RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature of the image generated using a 3072-bit RSA
   * private key and the SHA-256 hash function. The signed region of an image
   * starts immediately after this field and ends at the end of the image.
   *
   * On-target verification should also integrate usage constraints comparison
   * to signature verification to harden it against potential attacks. During
   * verification, the digest of an image should be computed by first reading
   * the usage constraints from the hardware and then concatenating the rest of
   * the image:
   *
   *   digest = SHA256(usage_constraints_from_hw || rest_of_the_image)
   *
   * The start and the length of the region that should be concatenated to the
   * usage constraints read from the hardware can be obtained using
   * `manifest_digest_region_get()`.
