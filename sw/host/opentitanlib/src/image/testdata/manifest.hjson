 * Manifest for boot stage images stored in flash.
 *
 * OpenTitan secure boot, at a minimum, consists of three boot stages: ROM,
 * ROM_EXT, and the first owner boot stage, e.g. BL0. ROM is stored in the
 * read-only ROM while remaining stages are stored in flash. This structure
 * must be placed at the start of ROM_EXT and first owner boot stage images so
 * that ROM and ROM_EXT can verify the integrity and authenticity of the next
 * stage and configure peripherals as needed before handing over execution.
 *
 * Use of this struct for stages following the first owner boot stage is
 * optional.
 *
 * Note: The definitions in
 * sw/host/rom_ext_image_tools/signer/image/src/manifest.rs must be updated if
 * this struct is modified. Please see the instructions in that file.
