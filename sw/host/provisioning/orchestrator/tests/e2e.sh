# This tests fuly provisioning an OpenTitan chip by executing both CP and FT
# stages in a single execution of the orchestrator script.

# This script is run by a Bazel sh_test rule, which sets RUNFILES_DIR to point
# at the test's runfiles. However, if RUNFILES_DIR is set, orchestrator.zip will
# inherit its value instead of setting it to the proper directory. This breaks
# runfile resolution, so we unset this variable here.

# Run tool. The path to the --sku-config parameter is relative to the
# runfiles-dir. Note: "use-ext-clk" flag on FPGA does nothing, but this tests
# the flag can be piped through to the test harness.
