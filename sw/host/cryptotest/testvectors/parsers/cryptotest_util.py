    """Parser for NIST `.rsp` files.

    NIST response files (.rsp) provide the expected results of cryptographic
    operations. No formal standard exists for these files, but they generally take
    the following format:
      - Lines beginning with a "[" are headers. Headers contain either a bare name,
        like "Section Name", a single key-value pair, like "Hash = SHA-256", or a
        list of strings, like "RSA-2048, SHA-256".
      - A line that starts with a "#" is a comment and is ignored.
      - Other non-blank lines contain a single key-value pair.
    Due to the heterogeneity of these files, this function applies multiple complex
    rules to parse the content into a set of test vectors:
      - Some key-value pairs are applied to multiple test cases. These include the
        key-value pairs in headers, as well as those with keys specified in the
        argument array `persists`.
      - A group of non-header key-value pair lines (delimited by newlines or a header
        line) constitutes a test case if it does not contain any keys in `persists`.
      - If a group of non-header key-value pair lines contains the same key multiple
        times without a newline in between, all of their associated values will be
        kept in a list.
