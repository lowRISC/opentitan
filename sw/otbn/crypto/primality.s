/**
 * Tests one potential witness for the Miller-Rabin primality test.
 *
 * Returns r = 2^256-1 if w is possibly prime, 0 if w is composite.
 *
 * Corresponds to the loop body of Algorithm 4.24 of the Handbook of Applied
 * Cryptography or section B.3.1 of FIPS 186-5. The full algorithm as described
 * by FIPS 186-5 is reproduced here for reference:
 *   1. Let a be the largest integer such that 2^a divides w-1.
 *   2. m = (w-1) / 2^a
 *   3. wlen = len (w).
 *   4. For i = 1 to iterations do
 *     4.1 Obtain a string b of wlen bits from a DRBG. Convert b to an integer
 *     using the algorithm in B.2.1.
 *     4.2 If ((b <= 1) or (b >= w-1)), then go to step 4.1.
 *     4.3 z = b^m mod w.
 *     4.4 If ((z = 1) or (z = w - 1)), then go to step 4.7.
 *     4.5 For j = 1 to a - 1 do.
 *       4.5.1 z = z^2 mod w.
 *       4.5.2 If (z = w - 1), then go to step 4.7.
 *       4.5.3 If (z = 1), then go to step 4.6.
 *     4.6 Return COMPOSITE.
 *     4.7 Continue.
 *   5. Return PROBABLY PRIME.
 *
 * This routine corresponds to steps 4.3 through 4.7.
 *
 * This loop needs to be constant-time relative to w if w is possibly prime (if
 * we find proof that w is composite we are permitted to break early). To make
 * the algorithm constant-time, we need to:
 *   - Compute b^(w-1) mod w in one loop, rather than separate into b^m mod w
 *     and a squaring loop for trailing zeroes.
 *   - Keep track of whether we have already reached a "step 4.7" condition,
 *     meaning we should return that w is possibly prime regardless of the rest
 *     of the loop.
 *
 * For each bit of (w-1), if we are in the case where all the remaining bits
 * are 0 (steps 4.4-4.5 of the FIPS procedure), then we have four possible
 * cases:
 *   1. If z == w - 1, then b is a witness to the primality of w regardless of
 *      what happens in the rest of the loop (step 4.4/step 4.5.2).
 *   2. If z == 1 and the current bit of (w - 1) is 1, then b is a witness to
 *      the primality of w regardless of what happens in the rest of the loop
 *      (step 4.4).
 *   3. If z == 1 and the current bit of (w - 1) is 0, then w is composite and
 *      we can exit early (optional and not currently implemented).
 *   4. If none of the above, we should continue the exponentiation.
 *
 * In pseudocode, the constant-time variant of steps 4.3-4.7 above looks like:
 *   z = 1
 *   possibly_prime = false // 0 represents "composite"
 *   for i=wlen-1 down to 0 {
 *     // Perform the next step of modular exponentiation.
 *     wi = ((w - 1) >> i) & 1
 *     z = wi ? (z^2 * b) mod w : (z^2) mod w
 *
 *     // Get the lower bits (to see if they're all zero).
 *     w_low = (w - 1) mod (2^i)
 *
 *     // Determine if b is a witness to the primality of w.
 *     possibly_prime |= ((w_low == 0) && (z == w-1))
 *     possibly_prime |= ((w_low == 0) && (wi == 1) && (z == 1))
 *   }
 *   return possibly_prime
 *
 * Expects the Montgomery constants for w to be precomputed before entry. For
 * this routine, R = 2^(n*256) and R/2 < w < R. None of the input buffers may
 * overlap in DMEM. This routine runs in constant time relative to w if w is
 * possibly prime.
