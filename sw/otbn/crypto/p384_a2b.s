/**
 * Converts arithmetic shares mod p to boolean shares.
 *
 * Calls the 385-bit A2B function twice, first using unmodified 384-bit shares
 * in reduced form, and then using modified 385-bit shares in unreduced form.
 *
 * It then checks if the MSB (carry bit) is true or false, to decide
 * which of the two A2B results is used. This detects and handles an
 * underflow during the subtraction of arithmetic masking.
 *
 * The logic behind the carry bit handling is as follows:
 * If x >= r, then  A = (x - r) mod p = x - r exactly.
 * So when we add 2^385 - p and then add A and x, we get
 * (2^385 - p + x - r + r) mod 2^385 = 2^385 - p + x.
 * In this case, the high bit is always true since p - x <= p < 2^384,
 * so we choose the A2B conversion without the 2^385 - p added.
 * On the other hand, if x < r, then A = (x - r) mod p = x - r + p.
 * When we add 2^385 - p and then add A and x, we get
 * (2^385 - p + x - r + p + r) mod 2^385 = (2^385 + x) mod 2^385 = x.
 * In this case, the high bit is always false since x < p < 2^384, so we
 * choose this second A2B conversion.
 *
 * This routine runs in constant time.
 *
 * Flags: Flags have no meaning beyond the scope of this subroutine.
