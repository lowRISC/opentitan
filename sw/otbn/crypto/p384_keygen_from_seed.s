/**
 * P-384 ECC secret key generation.
 *
 * Returns the secret key d in two 448-bit shares d0 and d1, such that:
 *    d = (d0 + d1) mod n
 * ...where n is the curve order.
 *
 * This implementation follows FIPS 186-5 section A.2.1, where we
 * generate d using a 384-bit seed. But while FIPS computes
 * d = (seed mod (n-1)) + 1 to ensure a nonzero key, we
 * instead just compute d = seed mod n. The caller MUST ensure that if this
 * routine is used, then other routines that use d (e.g. signing, public key
 * generation) are checking if d is 0.
 * To generate 448-bit key shares, we just take 63 bits from RND multiplied by n
 * and then added to the seed shares. (63 bits to prevent overflow.)
 *
 * Most complexity in this routine comes from masking. The input seed is
 * provided in two 384-bit shares, seed0 and seed1, such that:
 *   seed = seed0 ^ seed1
 * Bits at position 384 and above in the input shares will be ignored.
 *
 * We then use Goubin's boolean-to-arithmetic masking algorithm to switch from
 * this boolean masking scheme to an arithmetic one without ever unmasking the
 * seed. See Algorithm 1 here:
 * https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44709-1_2.pdf
 *
 * For a Coq proof of the correctness of the basic computational logic here
 * see:
 *   https://gist.github.com/jadephilipoom/24f44c59cbe59327e2f753867564fa28#file-masked_reduce-v-L226
 *
 * The proof does not cover leakage properties; it mostly just shows that this
 * logic correctly computes (seed mod n) and the carry-handling works.
 *
 * This routine runs in constant time.
 *
 * Flags: Flags have no meaning beyond the scope of this subroutine.

  /* At this point, we have arithmetic shares modulo 2^385:
       [w21, w20] : x0
       [w11, w10] : x1

     We know that x1=seed1, and seed and x1 are at most 384 bits. Therefore,
     the highest bit of x0 holds a carry bit modulo 2^384:
       x0 = (seed - x1) mod 2^385
       x0 = (seed - x1) mod 2^384 + (if (x1 <= seed) then 0 else 2^384)

     The carry bit then allows us to replace (mod 2^385) with a conditional
     statement:
       seed = (x0 mod 2^384) + x1 - (x0[384] << 384)

     Note that the carry bit is not very sensitive from a side channel
     perspective; x1 <= seed has some bias related to the highest bit of the
     seed.

     From here, we want to convert to shares modulo n.
     We compute the new shares as follows:
       c = (x0[384] << 384) mod n
       d0 = (x0 mod 2^384) - c) mod n
       d1 = x1 mod n

       d = seed mod n = (d0 + d1) mod n
