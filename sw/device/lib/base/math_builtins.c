/**
 * @file
 * @brief Implementations of libgcc-style polyfills for arithmetic.
 *
 * This file has no header, since its functions should not be called directly;
 * the compiler will generate calls into them as needed.
 *
 * The functions have names like `_ot_builtin_*`, rather than their libgcc
 * names, so that they can coexist with libgcc/libcompiler-rt on the host-side
 * for the purpose of unit tests. The linker aliases for the libgcc names only
 * exist on the device-side.
 *
 * See https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/compiler-rt/lib/builtins
 * for a detailed specification of the ABI we implement in this file.
 *
 * The provided functions here are:
 * - 64-bit shifts.
 * - 32-bit popcount, parity, bswap, clz, ctz, and find first.
 *
 * Although the RISC-V B extension provides instructions for some ofthese, we
 * currently do not require using a Clang that is aware of how to codegen them,
 * so LLVM may choose to emit libgcc polyfill symbols (like the following)
 * instead. Once we mandate such a Clang, they should be removed.
