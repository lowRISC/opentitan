            ## Provisioning of RMA_UNLOCK_TOKEN

            The RMA_UNLOCK_TOKEN is used to take a device from a production ls_state (i.e. DEV,
            PROD) in to RMA state. RMA entry is conditional to flash erase, and it also triggers
            a diversification change in the key manager to ensure that user assets are not exposed
            to the manufacturer.

            Since RMA enables debug interfaces in the chip, it is important to maintain the
            confidentiality of the RMA_UNLOCK_TOKEN. For this reason, asymmetric encryption is
            used to export the token.

            The manufactuer is expected to maintain the RMA_UNLOCK_TOKEN decryption key in an
            offline HSM.

            ## Personalization

            The device is configured with a unique set of secrets, which once provisioned, are
            hidden from software. These secrets are used as the root of the key derivation
            function in the key manager.

            ## Test steps

            ### Prep steps
            - Pre-load the OTP state with an image of an individualized device. See
              manuf_ft_sku_individualization for more details.
            - Check expected ls_state and OTP locked partitions (SECRET1, HW_CFG).
            - Check the device lifecyle to be set in DEV, PROD or PROD_END state.
            - Initialize entropy source in FIPS mode. Check health status after setting appropriate
              health test parameters.

            ### Device secrets
            - Instantiate the SW CSRNG, and configure it to generate data.
            - Configure the Silicon Creator secret info flash partition.
            - Uninstantiate the SW CSRNG.
            - Instantiate the SW CSRNG, and configure it to generate data.
            - Configure the following OTP entries with data extracted from the CSRNG:
              - CREATOR_ROOT_KEY_SHARE0
              - CREATOR_ROOT_KEY_SHARE1
            - Uninstantiate the SW CSRNG.
            - Lock SECRET2 OTP partition.
            - Perform reset triggered by software.

            ### RMA provisioning
            - Instantiate the SW CSRNG, and configure it to generate data.
            - Configure RMA_TOKEN in the OTP partition with data extracted from the CSRNG.
            - Encrypt RMA_TOKEN with asymmetric algorithm (e.g RSA-3072). The encrypted blob will
              be sent to the host in the result status.
            - Uninstantiate the sw CSRNG.

            ### Device Identity

            The OWNER_SW_CFG_ROM_KEYMGR_ROM_EXT_MEAS_EN OTP must be configured so that the
            attestation measurement can be provided in the manifest of the test program. This
            way the provisioning program is able to generate the key manager derivation matching
            the production ROM_EXT configuration.

            TODO: Left details vague on purpose until we get the attestation flow reviewed.
            - Advance the keymgr to CREATOR_ROOT_KEY state.
            - Derive CREATOR attestation key pair.
            - Calculate SHA2 hash of the public key with the device secret provisionined in
              the manuf_cp_device_info_flash_wr test. The device secret is known by the
              provisioning appliance.
            - Disable the key manager.
            - Configure OWNER_SW_CFG_ROM_KEYMGR_ROM_EXT_MEAS_EN OTP to switch to attestation mode
              associated with the device SKU.

            ### Result status
            - Send response to host with test result serialized in JSON format. The result must
              include the encrypted RMA_UNLOCK_TOKEN, the DEVICE_ID, the public attestation key
              and its hash.

            The Silicon Creator is expected to lookup the RMA_UNLOCK_TOKEN in a manufacturing database
            using the DEVICE_ID and decrypt it at an offline location. The token cannot leave the
            secure environment in unencrypted form at any time, implying that there is a way for the
            secure environment to handle the decryption operation.

            - Select LC TAP via strap pins.
            - Power on the device.

            The following steps are performed via the LC TAP interface:
            - Read DEVICE_ID. Confirm expected response.
            - Load RMA_UNLOCK_TOKEN and request transition to RMA state.
            - Poll for status completion.
            - Reset device by toggling POR pin.

            RMA entry will trigger a rotation of scrambling keys. It is recommended to either
            connect to the CPU JTAG to continue debug, or bootstrap the device with new a firmware
            image. Otherwise the ROM will fail to boot.

            SRAM programs are loaded via JTAG which has no data integrity mechanism. To make sure that
            the program is not corrupted, the SRAM CRT computes the CRC of the entire program at runtime
            and compares it to the host provided data. This test verifies the CRC check is correctly done
            by running two tests:
            - load a SRAM program and make sure that it works as expected (print a message),
            - corrupt a byte in memory (where the program was loaded), try to re-run it and confirm that
              the CRT now reports a CRC mismatch error.
