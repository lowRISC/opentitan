 * Provision the HW_CFG OTP partition.
 *
 * The HW_CFG partition contains:
 * - Unique device identifier (DeviceId), which is a public value used to
 *   identify the device during manufacturing.
 * - Manufacturing state information generated by the manufacturer.
 * - Various digital logic configuration settings.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 * - ManufState is pre-populated in the appropriate flash info page.
 * - If DeviceId is already written to flash, the device ID provided must match.
 *   If the DeviceId slot in flash is all 0s, then the provided DeviceId will be
 *   what is written to OTP.
 *
 * Note: The test will skip all programming steps and succeed if the HW_CFG
 * parition is already locked. This is to facilitate test re-runs.
 *
 * The caller should reset the device after calling this function and call
 * `manuf_individualize_device_hw_cfg_check()` afterwards to confirm that the
 * OTP partition was successfully locked.
 *
 * @param flash_state Flash controller handle and state.
 * @param otp_ctrl OTP controller instance.
