 * - ROM key enable/disable flags
 * - AST and entropy complex configuration
 * - Various ROM feature knobs
 *
 * Note:
 * - The operation will fail if there are any pre-programmed words not equal

 * - This operation will explicitly NOT provision the FLASH_DATA_DEFAULT_CFG

 *   configured after all other provisioning operations are done, but before the
 *   partition is locked, and the final transport image is loaded.
 * - This function will NOT lock the partition either. This must be done after
 *   provisioning the final FLASH_DATA_DEFAULT_CFG filed mentioned above.
 * - The partition must be configured and the chip reset, before the ROM can be
 *   booted, thus enabling bootstrap.
