            Certain spi_device hardware constants are currently hard-coded in `spi_device.h` since
            they are not auto-generated yet. See #11740 for details.

            - Verify that the following constants defined in `spi_device.h` are up to date:
              - `kSpiDeviceSfdpAreaNumBytes`
              - `kSpiDeviceSfdpAreaOffset`
              - `kSpiDevicePayloadAreaOffset`
              - `kSpiDevicePayloadAreaNumBytes`
              - `kSpiDevicePayloadAreaNumWords`
              - `kSpiDeviceWelBit`
